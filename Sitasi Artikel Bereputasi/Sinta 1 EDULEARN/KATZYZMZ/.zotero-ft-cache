1. INTRODUCTION
The emergence of artificial intelligence has triggered a veritable revolution in all areas of society [1]. From medicine [2] to industry [3], from finance [4] to agriculture [5], and from education [6] to scientific research [7], AI has profoundly transformed the way we approach the problems and challenges of the modern world. Remarkable progress in machine learning and natural language comprehension has elevated artificial intelligence (AI) to a pivotal role in facilitating decision-making, automating tasks, and optimizing operational processes. In the academic world, AI has become ubiquitous at all levels [8], from primary to higher education [9], in all disciplines including health sciences, language teaching, mathematics education, engineering, translation teaching, mobile learning and nursing pain education. Using Morocco as a case study, traditional education and research systems have shortcomings that limit the full realisation of the country's academic and scientific potential. Thus, the integration of AI in education and research could catalyse significant advances in terms of efficiency, personalisation of learning and development of new research perspectives [10]. In this context, this article aims to discuss the impacts of using AI in higher education and scientific research. We examine how AI is being used to improve pedagogical methods, adapt to students' needs, and create new learning opportunities. We also discuss the challenges as well as the prospects and opportunities offered by AI for research and higher education. After this introduction, the rest of the paper is structured as follows:

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Over the past 5 years, the use of AI in higher education has grown rapidly [11]. Against this backdrop, several and various research studies [12] have been carried out to investigate the benefits and shortcomings of AI for higher education and research. Some researchers have carried out systematic reviews in specific specialties. In relation to the health sciences, Schwartz et al. [13] investigated the use of AI in medical education by examining machine learning best practices for assessing surgical expertise in virtual reality simulation. Mustapha [14] have studied the impact of AI on the teaching process in translation engineering. Shukla et al. [15] have carried out a bibliometric analysis of 30 years' use of AI in engineering. Hwang et al. [16] have conducted a study on the hot topics of AI research in mobile learning. Liang et al. [17] have carried out a bibliographical analysis and systematic review of the roles and research areas of AI in language teaching. Hwang et al. [18] have specifically analyzed the roles and trends of AI research in mathematics education. Harmon et al. [19] conducted an in-depth study on the use of AI and virtual reality in nursing education. In addition, the results of the recent study [20] on the use of AI in higher education from 2016 to 2022 showed "that in 2021 and 2022, the number of publications in the field of AI in education increased by almost two to three times compared with previous years". While the study [21] revealed an evolution of AI in higher education based on an analysis of scientific production indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases, and which deals with the use of AI in higher education. On the other hand, Richter et al. [22] have focused on applications of AI in higher education to reveal four main uses: i) profiling and predicting academic success [23]; ii) assessment [24], [25]; iii) adaptive systems and personalization; and iv) intelligent tutoring systems [26].
3. RESEARCH METHOD
To investigate the impact of AI on research and higher education in Morocco, we employed a mixed-methods approach, comprising both surveys and data analysis to holistically capture the impact of AI on higher education and research in Morocco. This methodology was designed to gather insights from educators and students across various universities in Morocco. This section presents the survey design, data collection and data analysis method.
3.1. Survey design 3.1.1. Teacher survey
We administered a structured questionnaire to university teachers across different universities in Morocco. The survey instrument was designed to elicit responses regarding their experiences, perceptions, and observations regarding the integration of AI in teaching, research, and administrative processes within the higher education sector. The survey also probed for insights into challenges and opportunities stemming from AI adoption.
3.1.2. Student survey
A separate survey was conducted among students from different universities of Morocco. This survey focused on students' perspectives on how AI technologies have influenced their learning experiences, including any perceived benefits or challenges. Additionally, we sought feedback on their interactions with AI-driven educational tools and platforms.
3.2. Data collection
The surveys were distributed electronically to the selected participants. The various universities in Morocco were targeted. Respondents were given ample time to complete the questionnaires.
3.3. Data analysis
Collected data were analyzed using statistical software to derive quantitative insights from the surveys. Descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions and averages, were calculated to summarize the responses. Additionally, qualitative responses were subjected to thematic analysis to identify common themes and patterns in university teachers' and students' open-ended comments.

4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 4.1. Teacher survey
In this study, 52% of respondent teachers are female, while 47.7% are male. Figure 1 illustrates the number of participant. More than 38% of teachers are a little familiar with AI tools. Indeed 29% are moderately familiar with AI and 10% are not at all familiar with AI tools. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of these results.
Figure 1. Number of participant teachers Figure 2. How familiar are teachers with AI tools
As shown in Figure 3, AI is used in a few courses in 53% of institutions. However, AI is not used at all in 35% of educational institutions. More than 67% of teachers have used AI-based tools in their teaching or research. However, as depicted in Figure 4, 33% of the respondents have never used AI-based tools in their teaching or research. Teachers already used an AI tools in teaching and research. Figure 5 lists examples of these uses. Like, to provide translations and check language, detect plagiarism or fraud and create or adapt teaching materials (e.g., lesson plans, course notes, exam questions, scenarios, and video clips).
Figure 3. Use of AI in educational institutions Figure 4. Use of AI-based tools in teaching
Figure 5. Use of an AI tool
70% of teachers are able to use a computer or mobile device (cell phone, tablet) independently. They can also learn to use new AI tools relatively easily. Figure 6 shows a graphical representation of AI literacy in learning. If offered, teachers will use an AI tool mainly to create or adapt teaching materials (e.g. lesson plans, course notes, exam questions, case studies, video clips), then to detect plagiarism or cheating and to detect AI-generated texts with generative tools. Figure 7 shows the interest in using AI in education.

Figure 6. AI literacy in education
Figure 7. Intention to use AI in teaching
With regard to the anxiety linked to AI in higher education, 53% of teachers are apprehensive about using an AI tool for teaching. They will be also afraid of not using an AI tool correctly (42%), as shown in Figure 8. In this context, the results of the study [27] show that teachers express a degree of anxiety about the impact of AI on social life.
Figure 8. Anxiety about AI in education
Figure 9 shows that teachers ready to make efforts to use AI in teaching. More than 64% believe it would be easy to learn how to use an AI tool. In addition, 55% affirm they would clearly understand their role as a teacher in the use of an AI tool. On the one hand, as seen in Figure 10, more than 92% of teachers affirmed that the behavioral intention of actors in Moroccan higher education institutions can influence the adoption of AI. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 11, over than 95% of respondents confirmed that generative AI tools can never replace the physical presence and personality of a teacher in the classroom.

Figure 12 shows that 97% of teachers need additional training to make better use of AI in their field. In addition, the majority of teachers (91%) believe that AI has influenced or improved the quality of their research activities to varying degrees (Figure 13).
Figure 12. Need for training Figure 13. To what extent do you think AI has influenced or improved the quality of your research activities?
To sum up, the participants summarized the challenges facing the adoption of AI in higher education and research in Morocco in the lack of training, the lack of mastery of tools as well as ethical challenges. There are other challenges, gaps and even limits to AI mentioned Hagendorff and Wezel [28]. Faced with these challenges, teachers put forward some recommendations on how to overcome them, namely, programming targeted training for teachers, students and administrative staff, developing a public policy to support the use of AI in higher education. This has also been proposed and recommended in a number of studies [29].

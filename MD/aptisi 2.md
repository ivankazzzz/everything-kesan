ABSTRACT
This research examines the effect of project-based learning (PjBL) assisted
byethnoscience animation videos on students problem-solving skills and their
Pancasila character profile in science education. The study employed a quasi-
experimental design to evaluate the impact of independent variables (PjBL and
animated videos) on dependent variables (problem-solving skills and character
development). The research objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the
PjBL model in improving problem-solving skills and to determine its role in
developing Pancasila character dimensions in students. The study involved stu-
dents from classes VII-1 and VII-6 at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Middle School
as the sample. Data collection included test instruments to measure problem-
solving abilities and non-test instruments for assessing character dimensions of
the Pancasila student profile. Results showed significant differences in the av-
erage scores of problem-solving skills between the experimental and control
classes, with a significance value (2-tailed) of 0.00 <0.05. Similarly, for the
Pancasila student profile dimensions, the significance value was also 0.00 <
0.05, indicating a significant improvement in the experimental group. These
findings confirm that the PjBL model assisted by ethnoscience animation
videos is valid, practical, and effective for improving both problem-solving skills
and character development. In conclusion , integrating PjBL with ethnoscience
animation videos addresses the challenges in science education by aligning with
skill-based and culturally relevant learning approaches. The model supports stu-
dents cognitive and character development, making it suitable for application in
the Society 5.0 era.

1. INTRODUCTION
The very rapid changes in science and technology require us to be ready to face world changes,
especially in the field of education [1]. Character education is needed as a guide for Generation Z in facing
the current Era of Society 5.0 [2]. One form of this change is Society 5.0. The Era of Society 5.0 is humans
who can solve various social challenges and problems by utilizing various innovations that were born in the

era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and are centered on technology. Society 5.0 itself was first introduced by
the Japanese government in 2019 [3]. Society 5.0 is a development of the industrial revolution 4.0. Industrial
revolution 4.0 uses artificial intelligence, while Society 5.0 focuses on technological and human components
[4]. for the sake of progress in national development, especially science and technology education.
National Development covers various fields, one of which is education. While existing PjBL models
effectively foster collaboration and critical thinking, they often lack a cultural dimension that resonates with
students local contexts. This gap highlights the need for models that integrate cultural education, as seen
in ethnoscience animations, providing both academic and character-building benefits. Development in the
education sector is one of the efforts to increase Indonesia human resources who believe in God Almighty,
are virtuous, intelligent, creative and responsible. In the entire educational process, the learning process is the
most important and dominant activity. [5] this learning process can occur due to interaction between a person
and the environment, so learning can occur at any time, with anyone and anywhere. The success or failure of
achieving educational goals depends largely on the learning process experienced by a person [6, 7].
Education is a conscious and planned effort to create a learning atmosphere and learning process so
that students actively develop their potential to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intel-
ligence, noble morals, and the skills needed by themselves, society, nation and state [8]. This research is unique
as it integrates ethnoscience animation videos specifically designed to enhance cultural and character educa-
tion aligned with Indonesia Pancasila principles. Compared to previous studies, which primarily focused on
general multimedia tools, this approach incorporates local wisdom, making it culturally adaptive and relevant
to Society 5.0.
One of the educational problems faced by the Indonesian nation is the low quality of education. Even
though various efforts have been made by the government, to date the quality of education has not shown
significant improvement either at the primary and secondary education levels, or at the higher education level
[9, 10]. In the implementation of education, attention to the meaning of learning and its achievements is very
important and meaningful in the development of education in the future. In reality, student learning outcomes
are still far from what was expected, especially the problem solving skills and character values of the Pancasila
student profile (P3) which are very necessary in the era of society 5.0. The low problem solving skills of
students are also proven by the low scores obtained by Indonesian students in taking the Trends International
Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) test.
Based on the results of TIMSS research which measures students level of knowledge from just know-
ing facts and concepts and using them to solve simple problems to problems that require high levels of reason-
ing. The results of the TIMSS research in 2011 showed that the score obtained by Indonesia was 406, which
was the fifth smallest score, while in 2015 Indonesia obtained a score of 397, which was the fourth smallest
score out of 64 countries [11, 12]. Meanwhile, in 2019, based on TIMSS 2019 Participants, Indonesia did not
participate. Indonesian students only have some basic knowledge of biology, chemistry, physics and science.
the predicate obtained by Indonesia at TIMSS 2011 and 2015. Students have not been able to demonstrate and
convey knowledge of biology, chemistry, physics and science in various contexts. Students are also less able
to communicate, explain and solve problems, concepts related to biology, chemistry, physics in everyday life
well [13].
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results measure science, reading and mathe-
matics skills for 15 year old students. The PISA assessment is held every three years. The 2022 PISA study
report was recently announced on December 5, 2023. Indonesia is ranked 68th.
On the subject of reading skills, Indonesia recorded an average score of 359, 117 points away from
the global average score of 476, and down 12 points from the previous edition. Apart from that, the decline in
scores in this subject has also been the most significant in the last 5 editions [14]. Furthermore, on the subject
of mathematics skills, which is the main topic in PISA 2022, Indonesia average score fell 13 points to 366,
from the score in the previous edition of 379. This figure is also 106 points away from the global average score
[15].
A decrease in the average score of 13 points was also recorded in the science skills subject. In PISA
2022, Indonesia obtained an average score of 383 in this subject, 102 points behind the global average score.
These results again match the scores obtained in PISA 2009. Based on these results, Indonesian students are
still less capable in the concepts of scientific literacy, reading literacy and mathematical literacy. For more
clarity, see Figure 1.

Figure 1. PISA Indonesia results-Percentage of total number of students based on skill level (2022)
The results of observations in the field in 2023 in an interview with the head of the Science Subject
Teachers Conference stated that the science learning results for the North Medan sub-rayon of SMP Negeri
5 Medan, which consists of several schools, showed that 65% of students did not have good science learning
results. This is because the majority of teachers still use learning models that do not involve students actively
contributing to the learning process, students still often use gadgets. When teachers explain learning using
the method method because they are bored with the teacher’s explanation, so the character does not reflect the
profile of Pancasila students [16–18]. The majority of teachers have not optimized the use of technology as a
medium such as video and have not related learning to real life, and the cultural context and local wisdom in
accordance with the noble values of Pancasila, furthermore in terms of curriculum the replacement of the 2013
Curriculum with the Independent Curriculum is not all schools ready to implement This independent curriculum
is due to the lack of optimal driving teachers and driving schools that have been trained by the government to
be able to spearhead the implementation of the independent curriculum with efforts to strengthen educational
autonomy at the school level. The Merdeka Curriculum gives schools greater freedom to create a curriculum
that is more suited to student demographics and needs [19].
To overcome this problem, there are many things that must be done in order to improve the quality
of education, the most important thing is that it lies in the learning process activities in the classroom which
involve educators and students because the learning process activities that occur in schools are activities carried
out in the classroom which are not only based on mastery of fundamental principles, but also developing a
positive attitude towards learning, research, discovery and problem solving [20, 21]. The low quality of science
learning can be seen from various events or symptoms in people’s daily lives. The behavior of many community
members shows that they have never received science education, or that science education at school seems to
have no impact on the way of life and way of thinking of the majority of Indonesian people [22]. This research
contributes to addressing broader educational challenges, such as Indonesia performance in PISA and TIMSS,
by fostering problem-solving skills through culturally relevant and innovative teaching models. By integrating
character education with technological advancements, it provides a scalable model for improving scientific
literacy and skills in diverse contexts.
The solution to follow up on this problem is to apply a learning model that is able to actively involve
students and contribute to the learning process in class so that students science problem solving skills improve
and the learning process becomes more meaningful. One innovative model that can improve students prob-
lem solving skills is the Project Based Learning (PjBL) model. The learning process through PjBL allows
educators to learn from students and learn with students. Learning through PjBL can be used as a learning
model to develop students skills in planning, communicating, solving problems and making decisions. Project-
based learning relies on the idea that students construct their own knowledge based on their own experiences.
Project-based learning is seen as an approach to creating a learning environment that can encourage students
to construct knowledge and skills personally. Students will learn collaboratively in small groups as a means so
that they can convey ideas, listen to other people’s ideas, and reflect their own ideas to others [23]. It is with this
concept that the project-based learning model is considered relevant and can be further developed if adapted to
the spirit of independent learning. Conceptually, project-based learning and the spirit of independent learning

608 ❒ E-ISSN: 2656-8888 |P-ISSN: 2655-8807
have similarities, namely that they both give students the freedom to explore [24, 25]. In project-based learning,
students are given the opportunity to be active in class, but the teacher is still the main control. Apparently this
can be overcome if project-based learning is adapted to the spirit of independent learning. The teacher is no
longer the main actor in learning, but is now only a facilitator. Teachers are free to determine the methods and
how they want learning to be carried out. However, the process is completely left to the students [26, 27]. The
PjBL model can improve learning activities linked to objects that are able to explore and develop the academic
skills possessed by students. Apart from that, it can bring out students skills and creativity so that students
will be more proactive in learning activities. The PjBL model can encourage students to think more creatively
through solving problems together.
2. RESEARCH METHOD
This research was conducted at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Middle School, Medan, North Sumatra.
The selection of the selected experimental and control classes was carried out using a cluster random sampling
technique using a quasi-experimental method with a post test only control group design research design. The
following research design is shown in Table 1.

The research subjects were all students of class VII-SMP Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo for the 2023/2024
academic year. Sampling was carried out using purposive sampling technique for the experimental class and
control class. This carefully designed experimental setup ensures that the results directly reflect the effective-
ness of the PjBL learning model with ethnoscience animation, providing a robust basis for analyzing its impact
on problem-solving skills and character development. The sample class was determined randomly to determine
the control class and experimental class after homogeneity testing, so classes VII-1 and VII-6 had the most sim-
ilar characteristics. The experimental class that was intervened with the PjBL model assisted by ethnoscience
animation videos was class VII-1, while the control class was intervened with the project-based learning model,
namely class VII-6. The instrument used to obtain data on the level of effectiveness of the video-assisted PjBL
learning model is to build problem-solving skills and the Pancasila student profile character of students. This
instrument is used to measure problem solving skills through test instruments in the form of essay questions
and the character profile of Pancasila students through non-test instruments in the form of questionnaires.
Several analyzes were carried out in testing the implementation of the PjBL learning model assisted
by ethnoscience animated videos.
2.1. Normality test
The purpose of the normality test is to find out whether the sample data is normally distributed or not.
Normality test analysis in this research uses the Kolmogorov Smirnov test using SPSS 25 software. The basis
for decision making in the normality test in this research is that if the significance value is >0.05, then the
research sample data comes from a normally distributed population. The implementation of the PjBL learning
model assisted by ethnoscience animation utilized the following tools and software, namely:
• SPSS 25 for statistical analysis.
• Adobe Animate for developing ethnoscience animation videos.
• Microsoft Excel for data recapitulation and visualization. These tools ensured accuracy in data analysis
and the creation of engaging visual content tailored for the target demographic.

2.2. Homogeneity test
The homogeneity of variance test was carried out on data on problem solving skills and character
profiles of Pancasila students to prove whether the two sample groups had the same or homogeneous variance
and whether the data was not distributed homogeneously. Analysis of the homogeneity test in this study uses
the Levene test using SPSS 22 software. The hypothesis of the homogeneity test in this study is that if the
significance value is >0.05, then the data distribution is homogeneous.
2.3. Independent Sample T-Test
The independent sample t-test was carried out to see whether there was a significant difference be-
tween problem solving skills and the character of the Pancasila student profile of students who applied the
PjBL learning model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos and those who applied the Project based Learn-
ing model. The basis for decision making in the independent sample t-test is that if the significance value is <
0.05 then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The field test of the PjBL learning model assisted by the AN ethnoscience animation video was carried
out at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Middle School for 10 lesson hours in 5 meetings, each meeting 2 lesson hours.
At this stage, we will test the effectiveness of the PjBL learning model assisted by ethnoscience animated
videos on problem solving skills and Pancasila student profile characters between the control class and the
experimental class.
The results of the comparison of the average problem solving skill scores and character profiles of
Pancasila students in the experimental class and control class can be seen in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Comparison of the achievement of problem solving skills and profiles of Pancasila students in the

Data on problem solving skills and character profiles of Pancasila students are then carried out pre-
requisite tests to see the normality and homogeneity of the data group. Test calculations Recapitulation of
normality test results of data on problem solving skills and profiles of Pancasila students in the experimental
class and control class can be seen in Table 2.

3.1. Normality Test
The normality test was conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The significance value for both
the experimental and control classes exceeded 0.05, indicating that the data were normally distributed. In Table
3, the SPSS output results for testing the normality of data on problem solving skills using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test, the significance value is 0.161, >0.05 for the experimental class and the significance value is
0.200>0.05 for the control class, this shows that the overall data the experimental and control classes are
normally distributed.

Table 4 presents the normality test results for Pancasila student profiles, including the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. For both the ”P3.Experiment.Class” and ”P3.Control.class”, the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test showed p-values of 0.200 and 0.161, respectively, indicating no significant deviation from nor-
mality. The Shapiro-Wilk test also supported this conclusion, with p-values of 0.268 for the experiment class
and 0.778 for the control class, further suggesting that both data sets follow a normal distribution. The note for
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the reported significance is a lower bound of the true significance,
implying that the actual p-values could be slightly higher, which would further confirm the normality of the
data.

Based on the results of both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests, it can be concluded
that the data for both the experimental and control classes, as well as for the Pancasila student profiles, are
normally distributed. This suggests that the assumptions required for parametric testing are met, and subsequent
statistical analyses can proceed without concerns related to non-normality. The significance values above
0.05 further support the conclusion that the data follows a normal distribution, ensuring the reliability of the
statistical results that will follow in the analysis.

The significant improvements in the experimental group may stem not only from the innovative use of
ethnoscience animation but also from the active engagement fostered by the PjBL model. However, it’s worth
considering that the novelty of the method might have temporarily heightened student interest, suggesting the
need for longitudinal studies to evaluate sustained impact. In Table 6, the results of the SPSS output to test
the homogeneity of the data of problem solving skills using the Levene Statistics test with a significance value
of 0.072 >0.05 for the experimental class and for the control class, this shows that the overall data of the

solving skills and character of the Pancasila student profile were tested using independent sample t-test analysis.
3.3. Independent Sample T-Test
An independent sample t-test was conducted to assess the significance of differences between the
experimental and control groups. Table 8 presents the results:

Pancasila Student Character ProfileExperiment0,00Control
Based on Table 8, for the problem solving skills and profile character of Pancasila students, a signif-
icance value of 0.00 <0.05 is obtained, so there is a significant difference in the problem solving skills and
profile character of Pancasila students in classes that use the PjBL learning model assisted by ethnoscience
animation videos with those in classes that using the PjBL learning model. The test results can be interpreted
that the PjBL learning model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos is effective in building problem solving
skills and Pancasila Student Profile Characteristics.
The results obtained show that the PjBL learning design assisted by ethnoscience animated videos
has an influence on students problem solving skills and Pancasila student profiles [28]. Furthermore, the PjBL
learning model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos has high effectiveness on problem solving skills and
the profile of Pancasila students. This is because almost the entire syntax of the PjBL learning model assisted
by ethnoscience animated videos facilitates students to build these skills. Furthermore, the use of model books,
student books and project-based learning modules helps students to build problem-solving skills and a Pancasila
student profile [29]. The use of ethnoscience animated video media in learning can also influence the character
of students Pancasila student profiles, The findings suggest practical applications in curriculum development,

612 ❒ E-ISSN: 2656-8888 |P-ISSN: 2655-8807
particularly in schools transitioning to the Independent Curriculum. However, scaling this approach would
require significant investment in teacher training and digital infrastructure, ensuring that schools in under-
resourced areas can also benefit [30]. This is because the use of technology in learning can improve the
character of students Pancasila student profiles. states that being able to teach with technology requires an
understanding of how technology and content interact to support learning. This skill involves the knowledge
to use a digital tool or application with all the features. This is reinforced by [31] that lecturers can continue to
model the use of technology so that teachers can further update their technological knowledge through learning.
The problem solving skills and character profile of Pancasila students have high effectiveness, this is
because the syntax supports these skills. Apart from that, the use of ethnoscience animated video media in
learning can help students to develop the character of a Pancasila student profile, can support science learning
[32] and is suitable for investigation and problem solving [33]. The learning approach must provide a favorable
environment for students so that they gain more experience in understanding the science process [34], similar
to project-based learning which can help students achieve learning outcomes [35]. PjBL is the core in devel-
oping the PjBL model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos. PjBL has been widely applied in science
classrooms to support students in developing a deeper understanding of science concepts [36] developing skills
that are relevant in the 21st century [37]. Apart from that, it can improve the quality of learning. The findings
of [38] show that with projects students feel enthusiastic and actively discuss with other students, and improve
communication skills, creativity, teamwork and critical thinking [39] and metacognitive [40]. Project learning
has the potential to increase student engagement by focusing on driving questions that connect scientific prac-
tice, this allows students to collaborate and seek answers to driving questions and allows students to produce
real products as a result of the project [41]. However, the approach may face limitations in regions where
ethnoscience resources are scarce or underdeveloped [42]. Additionally, the integration of animation videos
might present challenges in schools with limited technological access [43]. Compared to other project-based
approaches, such as generic multimedia tools, ethnoscience animations provide contextual relevance but may
require extensive customization [44].
4. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
Educational managers are encouraged to adopt innovative teaching methods by integrating PjBL with
animated videos, as this approach has been shown to enhance both problem-solving skills and character devel-
opment. To support this, schools should invest in comprehensive teacher training programs that equip educators
with the necessary skills to effectively utilize digital tools in their classrooms, thereby ensuring higher levels of
student engagement and improved learning outcomes. Furthermore, curriculum design needs to be enriched by
embedding PjBL combined with digital media to achieve a balance between cognitive skill improvement and
character-building in line with modern educational objectives.
5. CONCLUSION
The findings of this study show that there is a significant influence of the Project-Based Learning
(PjBL) model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos on problem-solving skills and the character profile of
Pancasila students. The use of ethnoscience animated video media provides a meaningful learning experience
by integrating cultural values and scientific concepts, making learning more relevant and engaging for students.
This approach not only enhances students problem solving abilities but also fosters the development of the
Pancasila character dimensions, including critical thinking, collaboration, and cultural awareness.
The significant improvement observed in the experimental group indicates that the PjBL model, when
supported by multimedia tools such as ethnoscience animated videos, can bridge the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical application. Furthermore, the use of technology in learning positively influences
character development by encouraging students to apply Pancasila values namely creativity, independence, and
mutual respect through collaborative projects and problem-based tasks.
The results emphasize that adopting the PjBL model assisted by ethnoscience animated videos is
a valid, practical, and effective solution to address current challenges in science education. It aligns with
the demands of the Society 5.0 era, where skill-based and culturally relevant education is essential. Future
implementation of this model can support students in developing both cognitive skills and character dimensions,
equipping them to become well-rounded individuals who are ready to face global challenges while upholding
local values.

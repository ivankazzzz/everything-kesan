1. INTRODUCTION
Mathematics is a science that is widely used in everyday life. The importance of using mathematics in everyday life makes mathematics a science that must be mastered by everyone. Therefore, mathematics is one of the compulsory subjects taught in schools. Although mathematics has many benefits for everyday life and is a compulsory subject taught in schools, mathematics is actually one of the subjects that some students dislike and even fear, so that some students tend to avoid the lesson. The level of difficulty in solving math problems is one of the reasons students avoid math lessons and even make mathematics a deadly subject.
For a mathematics teacher, making students love mathematics is a fairly difficult job. Therefore, mathematics teachers are expected to be able to create a pleasant learning atmosphere therefore students do not avoid and fear mathematics lessons and can like mathematics lessons which make students easier to understand the mathematical material taught by the teacher. By using the right teaching materials, it is hoped that it can improve students' learning abilities. There are many teaching materials that can be used in a learning process. One of the teaching materials that can be designed by teachers as a tool for students to understand learning materials is the Student Worksheet (LKPD). The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (2008: 13) stated that LKPD (student worksheets) are sheets containing tasks that must be done by students, usually in the form of instructions, steps to complete the task by referring to the Basic Competence (KD) to be achieved. By using LKPD in the mathematics learning process, it is hoped that it can help students build their own knowledge independently or in groups by utilizing students' knowledge regarding the learning materials that have been studied.
Andi Prastow, (2011: 204) stated that LKPD can also be defined as printed teaching materials in the form of sheets of paper containing material, summaries, and instructions for carrying out tasks that must be done by students, which refers to the achieved basic competencies. Akbar (2013: 45) stated that the learning approach is as follows: perspective to teach students through a certain center of attention. One of the learning approaches that can be used by mathematics teachers is the Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (PMRI) approach. PMRI is a mathematical approach adapted from Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) which is applied in the Netherlands and has been adapted to the conditions of culture, geography, and the life of the Indonesian people. PMRI is an approach that uses realistic student situations that can be imagined by students because they are related to everyday life.
PMRI is an adaptation of Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) which is mathematics learning where human and mathematical activities must be connected significantly to the context of students' daily lives as a source of development through the mathematization process both horizontally and vertically. (Zulkardi in Zabeta, et al., 2015: 100).
Abdussakir (2010: 2) stated that one of the lessons that must be mastered by students is geometry. Geometry is a branch of mathematics that occupies a special position in the curriculum because of the many concepts contained in applications in everyday life. One of the discussions in geometry is the curved side of solid. Therefore, students must know the formulas used to determine the surface area and volume of curved side of solid.
For this reason, students must use their reasoning first to identify what problems are contained in the problem and determine the right formula to solve the problem. But not all students can quickly identify the problems contained in the questions, because some students who have poor cognitive abilities will have difficulty identifying and solving problems contained in the questions. Therefore, teachers are needed to design teaching materials such as Student Worksheets (LKPD) which are equipped with certain learning approaches such as Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (PMRI) to help students who have difficulty solving problems related to curved side of solid.

2. METHODOLOGY
The method used in this research is the research and development method or (R&D). According to Gay (1990), research and development is an effort or activity to develop an effective product for schools, and not to test theory . Meanwhile, according to Sugiyono (2017: 297) Research and Development is research that is used to produce certain products, and test the effectiveness of these products.
The subjects in this study were students of class IX Amayatul Huda Middle School in the academic year 2021/2022 and the object of this research was Student Worksheets (LKPD) based on Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (PMRI) on the subject of Surface Area of Curved Side of Solid. The development used was the method and development according to Sugiyono (2017: 298) who is stating that the steps in Research and Development (R & D) research consist of 10 steps, such as: 1) Potential and problems; 2) Data collection; 3) Product design; 4) Design validation; 5) Design revision; 6) Product trial; 7) Product Revision; 8) Trial of use; 9) Product Revision; 10) Mass production.
Data collection techniques used in this study were in the form of questionnaires and interviews. The research instrument used in this study was a product validation questionnaire in the form of Student Worksheets (LKPD) and interview guidelines. Data analysis in this research used quantitative and qualitative analysis.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results of this study were carried out using the Sugiyono (2017: 298) development procedure:
Potential and Problems
Before conducting research, researchers first determined the potential and problems which would then be analyzed for needs. To find out the potential and existing problems, the researchers conducted interviews with the mathematics teacher at Amayatul Huda Middle School. The interviews conducted were unstructured interviews about the use of teaching materials and the application of the Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (PMRI) approach in the mathematics learning process. Based on the results of the interview, it was found that the PMRI approach was occasionally applied in the mathematics learning process. The implementation of realistic mathematics education in the mathematics learning process was a potential. However, there were also problems such as the lack of use of the PMRI approach in a mathematics learning process. The PRMI approach was only applied to some story problems. In addition, the PMRI approach has never been used formally in a learning device such as lesson plans, teaching materials or Student Worksheets (LKPD).
Information Gathering
After knowing the potential and existing problems, the researchers then collected information through interviews with mathematics subject teachers. A lot of information obtained by researchers was used to plan products that were expected to overcome the problem of the lack of application of a realistic mathematical approach to the learning process. For this reason, researchers used a product in the form of Student Worksheets (LKPD). After determining the product to be developed, the researcher then made the LKPD product design using the PMRI approach.
Product Design
After collecting information, the next step was to compile and develop teaching materials for Student Worksheets (LKPD) based on Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (PMRI). Reference sources in developing teaching materials for Student Worksheets (LKPD) were obtained from sources that refer to the materials used in Competency Standards, Basic Competencies, Competency Achievement Indicators, learning objectives, activities in LKPD with the PMRI approach.

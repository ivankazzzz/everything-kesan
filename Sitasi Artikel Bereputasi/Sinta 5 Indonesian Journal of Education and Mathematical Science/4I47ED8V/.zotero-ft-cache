Concept map, learning outcome, Islamic education
Teachers are the main and very important component in education and determine the success or failure of achieving goals in the learning process. The selection of appropriate learning methods is something that must be considered by the teacher. Based on this, research was conducted on the implementation of the Concept Map method. The formulation of the problem in this study is how the learning outcomes of Islamic Education of students before using the Concept Map method, how the process of implementing learning using the Concept Map method, and how the learning outcomes of Islamic Education of students after using the Concept Map method in class VIII SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam. The main purpose of this study was to determine the learning outcomes of 8th grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam by using the Concept Map method. This study used classroom action research which was carried out for two cycles. Data collection procedures were through student learning outcomes tests. Overall, the results of research that took place over two cycles showed that learning by using the Concept Map method based on the results of the data obtained, showed that in cycle I the learning outcomes of students had an average score of 71.11 (48.14%) and there was an increase in cycle II with an average score of 82.22 (85.18%). The Learning by using the Concept Map method has a significant change in the learning outcomes of students.

1. INTRODUCTION
Education is very important in real life. Education is expected to form an educated and civilised human character in real life. In addition, education is a conscious and planned effort in the process of guiding and learning for individuals to grow and develop into independent, responsible, knowledgeable, healthy, and noble humans (Suyadi, 2017). Education is a process that serves to guide students in life in accordance with the developmental tasks that students must undergo. The task of development includes aspects of life needs both as a person and as a member of society that takes place gradually. When viewed broadly, humans who live and develop are humans who are always changing and that change is called the result of learning (Purnamawati, 2018). Education is a very important thing in the life of the nation's progress and regression which is determined by the education that is provided in the country. Likewise, whether someone is successful is determined by their knowledge, skills and good personality. For this reason, education is needed. In a simple sense, education can be interpreted as a human effort in building and shaping a personality that is in accordance with the norms and values that develop in the society where a person is. Ki Hajar Dewantara as quoted by Azyumardi Azra, argues that: "Education in general means various efforts in realising the nobleness (inner strength), intellectual and physical strength of children, in line with the dynamics of society and the environment (Azyumardi Azra, 2017). Education is also important to produce human resources who believe and are pious and required in Islam. As Allah says in surah Al-Mujadalah verse 11 which means "Allah will raise the degrees of those among you and those who study knowledge". Effective and efficient learning will take place when it can provide increased success for students and teachers themselves. Learning is also seen as influencing students to learn or it can be stated that learning is an effort to teach students, the visible result of the act of learning is that students will learn something that they would not have learned without the act of learning (Widodo Abu Ahmadi, 2017). One aspect of this education can be obtained from the learning process of Islamic religious education. Based on Law No.20 of 2003 concerning the National Education System in article 1, it is explained that: "Education is a conscious and planned effort to create a learning atmosphere and learning process with the objective that students can actively develop their potential to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intelligence, noble character, and skills needed by themselves, society, nation and country (Law of the Republic of Indonesia, 2003). Learning Islamic education prepares students to live a life based on Islamic, intellectual, religious and nationalist values. For this reason, determining the right method of learning is an absolute requirement that must be mastered by an educator (Abdilla & Turmudi, 2019). From the above statement, it can be concluded that the purpose of learning Islamic education is to increase students' understanding of Islamic values and improve Islamic teachings’ practice in everyday life. So in short, the main purpose of Islamic religious education is diversity, which is to be religiosity, intellectuality and humanity. In general, the Qur'an describes how important it is to use approaches, methods, models, techniques and strategies in doing something including in preparing for learning likewise, when dealing with problems. Allah says in Q.S Ali Imran verse 159:

Translation: "So by the grace of Allah you (Muhammad) were gentle with them. If you had been harsh and harshhearted, they would have withdrawn from your presence. So forgive them and ask forgiveness for them, and deal with them. Then when you have made up your mind, then put your trust in Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who put their trust in Him". The verse above, explains how Allah commands humans to be kind to others, including an educator to students is not encouraged to be rude in the learning process to achieve a learning goal successfully. In terms of educating, a method is needed to be applied to students and a gentle attitude of an educator to make students comfortable in the learning process. The ways that educators help students vary greatly, such as the application of new, interesting and efficient learning methods in order that students do not feel saturated or less interested in the material presented. Thus, this can encourage in improving student learning outcomes. In developing the teaching and learning process such as fostering self-confidence, innovative attitudes and behaviour and increased activity, it is very necessary to have an interrelationship between educational components, such as educators, students, curriculum, learning media and learning resources, materials, methods and evaluation instruments that work together to create a good learning process. Thus a renewal of Islamic education learning is needed. Learning that can be applied to change these conditions includes through the application of the Concept Map method. As stated by Komarudin, one of the changes in learning is the orientation of learning which was originally teachercentred to learner-centred, the methodology which was originally more dominated by expository changed to participatory and the approach which was originally more textual changed to contextual. All these changes are intended to improve the quality of education, both in terms of educational processes and outcomes (Trianto, 2017). The Concept Map method is an innovative method for individual learners to produce learning thoughts so that this can help learners clearly recognise what they have learned (Wulandari, 2022). Making a Concept Map can help students in designing and planning the problem solving process (Nurhabibah, 2021). The Concept Map method was chosen because this method can help students to be able to communicate, focus their attention, and plan, structure and solve a problem, then students are also able to explain the main points of thought more briefly and efficiently in order for students to obtain good learning outcomes (Muammar & Suhartina, 2018). Slameto argues that "The

conditions for effective learning, among others, are that educators must use methods when teaching. Varied methods result in the presentation of learning materials that are more interesting to students, easily accepted by students, the situation in the classroom is also alive and not monotonous" (Slameto, 2017). Based on the results of researchers' observations when carrying out Professional Capability Development (PKP) at SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam, it was found that the minimum standard for Islamic Education subjects was 75. The results of the researcher's interview with the Islamic Education teacher at the school, Mr Bambang Sutejo, S. Ag. Ag that the students' Islamic learning outcomes did not reach the minimum standard set by the school, then he invited a discussion with researchers about what methods were appropriately applied at SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam besides lecturing and memorising. Apart from his statement, researchers also found other problems such as, (1) students still consider Islamic learning as a tedious lesson and identical to memorising, (2) parents' attention to their children's learning outcomes is still insufficient, as proof when the distribution of report cards to parents, parents seem ignorant of the scores obtained by their children, (3) the methods used by educators are also still ineffective, such as how to manage classrooms that are still monotonous or passive. Inappropriate learning methods can cause learning to be less effective (Fatmawati, 2019).
2. METHODOLOGY
This research was conducted at SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam. This type of research used class action research which is one of the relevant research models carried out by educators to solve a learning problem in the classroom and improve the quality of learning. Classroom action research aims to improve the most effective and efficient learning strategies and train in developing teacher skills for more innovative learning. The purpose of this research method is to identify completely and deeply about the learning outcomes of students before and after using the Concept Map method and the process of implementing the use of the Concept Map method. The data collection techniques used in this study were 1) Observation by entering the class and directly reviewing the situation in the classroom, 2) Learning outcomes test, therefore students were given a test before using the Concept Map method and given another learning outcomes test after using the Concept Map method or commonly referred to as a posttest. 3) Documentation, including data related to students in the form of grades, photos that describe student activities while participating in the Concept Map method learning process.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
In cycle II, after seeing the shortcomings and problems that occurred in cycle I, the researchers again used the Concept Map method in cycle II on the material of obligatory fasting and Sunnah fasting. By doing this, the researcher observed and corrected where there was a lack of understanding and mastery of the material of mandatory fasting and sunnah fasting in students. After the action was taken and the learning outcomes test was given in cycle II, the learning outcomes of students with an average score increased to 85.18. The following below is a comparative table between pretest, posttest 1 in cycle I and posttest 2 in cycle II. Based on the implementation of actions for 2 cycles which were carried out 4 times a meeting, the data obtained that student learning outcomes have increased. The increase in learning outcomes is found by applying the Concept Map method. The results of observations of the application of the Concept Map method can be viewed in the following table:
Table 1 The Comparison of Pretest, Postest I and Postest II Results No Achievement of Learning Outcomes Pre Test Cycle I Cycle II 1. Average score 49,62 71,11 82,22 2. Number of students who are eligible 6 13 23 3. Percentage of mastery 22,22% 48,14% 85,18%
Based on the table above, it can be observed that there was a very clear improvement. In the pretest there were only 6 students who were proficient with an average score of 49.62. Then in cycle I it became 13 students with an average score of 71.11 and in cycle II it became 23 students with an average score of 82.22. This means that in cycle II there was an increase of 37.04% from cycle I. Therefore, it can be concluded that there was an increase in student learning outcomes through pretest to student learning outcomes in cycle II. In other words, the implementation of the Concept Map method can improve learning outcomes in Islamic Education in class VIII-B at SMP Muhammadiyah 16 Lubuk Pakam. Based on the learning outcomes in Islamic Education subjects using the Concept Map method can improve student learning outcomes, although there are still students who have not been able to solve the problems given by researchers. This can be observed from the progress of learning carried out from pretest, cycle I and cycle II. It can be seen when the pretest was carried out. The average value of students was 49.62, continued in cycle I and after learning using the Concept Map method in cycle I, the average value of students increased to 71.11 and was still below the expected learning mastery standard of 75. Based on the data analysis in cycle I, it can be concluded temporarily that by using the Concept Map method applied by researchers has not been able to

improve the learning outcomes of students on mandatory fasting and Sunnah fasting material individually and classically, so it still needs improvement by using the Concept Map method in cycle II. Table 2 Deskripsi Persentase Pretest, Siklus I Dan Siklus II
Based on the comparison table above, it can be concluded that there is an increase in student learning outcomes as evidenced by the average pretest score of 49.62, an increase in cycle I, with an average score of 71.11 where these results are better than the pretest results. The mastery of students' learning outcomes also increased in the posttest results of cycle II, which is 82.22. Of the 27 students 4 of them have not been able to answer the posttest questions given and are not complete. Therefore, the researcher approaches the four students again by often calling their names when explaining and often motivating students so that these students are enthusiastic about learning and not lazy to go to school.
4. CONCLUSION
Based on the results of the research that has been carried out, the researcher draws the following conclusions: 1. From the results of the pretest conducted by researchers, it can be seen from the test results that students have achieved with an average score of 49.62 (22.22%). This pretest was carried out before researchers applied the Concept Map method to students. 2. The implementation of the application of the Concept Map method carried out by researchers ran smoothly and in accordance with the previously designed lesson plan. The learning using the Concept Map method can increase the understanding of students to comprehend Islamic Education lessons on mandatory fasting and sunnah fasting material more easily and clearly and not monotonously. This is because it is learned directly by the students themselves and learning using the Concept Map method can allow students to learn independently anytime and anywhere according to their interests and abilities. Learners look active during the learning process using the Concep Map method. 3. Based on the data on the completeness of student learning outcomes in Islamic Education lessons using the Concep Map method, it has increased starting from the pretest and continuing with cycle I and cycle II. Showing in the pretest the average value of students 49.62 (22.22%) and in the first cycle posttest to 71.11 (48.14%) and in the second cycle obtained the average value of students 82.22 (85.18%). Learning by using the Concept Map method has a real impact on the learning outcomes of students, especially on the material of obligatory fasting and Sunnah fasting. It is clear from the difference in students who have changed starting from the pretest, cycle I and cycle II.

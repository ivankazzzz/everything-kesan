In educational institutions, teachers are a core part of the management element. Teachers who successfully carry out their main tasks and have the awareness to do something extra will be the key to the success of the organization. Extra activities carried out by teachers that are not directly related to the provisions regarding payroll are called OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behavior). Based on preliminary research, it was found that teachers at SMK PGRI Bogor Regency had relatively low OCB. Therefore, research was needed to obtain good information about other variables that were possibly used to increase OCB. The purpose of this study is to improve teacher OCB by conducting research on the relationship between personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice. This study used correlational statistical analysis methods to determine the relationship between the variables studied and the SITOREM method for indicator analysis in order to obtain optimal solutions in order to improve teacher OCB. The population of this study were 289 teachers of SMK PGRI in Bogor Regency. From the population, samples were taken using the Slovin formula and a sample of 168 people was obtained. The results of the analysis using the correlation method show that there is a positive relationship between personality and OCB with a correlation coefficient of ry1 = 0.603. It indicated that personality strengthening can increase OCB. There is a positive relationship between interpersonal communication and OCB with a correlation coefficient ry2 = 0,518 which indicated strengthening interpersonal communication can increase OCB. There is a positive relationship between organizational justice and OCB with a correlation coefficient of ry3 = 0.512 meaning that organizational justice can increase OCB. From the SITOREM analysis, the optimal solution is obtained. Of the 23 indicators studied, there are 14 indicators in good condition so these indicators only need to be maintained or developed, and there are 9 indicators that are still weak so they need to be improved. A priority order for their handling complements improvements to indicators that are still weak. Good indicators are supportive behaviour, technical factors, social status, friendliness, self-disclosure, openness to experience, emotional stability, prudence, wisdom, equality, consistency, maintaining ethics, being informative, and self-respect. The indicators that need to be improved in order of priority for handling are as follows: 1) Trust, 2) Openness, 3) Appreciation for inspiration, 4) Needs, 5) Politeness, 6) Virtue, 7) Prudence, 8) Sportsmanship, and 9 ) Altruism.

1. INTRODUCTION
Human resources in educational organizations play a very important role. It is based on the belief that the individual is the formulator of the organization's goals and at the same time the prime mover to achieve the goals. Every individual in the organization has an obligation to complete the main tasks in accordance with their responsibilities. As a member of the organization, individuals have an obligation to work together in realizing the goals of the organization. Such behaviour in modern management is called OCB.. Good OCB is the behaviour of teachers who are able to carry out the main tasks as stated in the job description coupled with the awareness of doing something that they believe can accelerate the achievement of organizational goals. This is shown through behaviours such as helping colleagues, being involved in the organizational structure of schools and professions, being tolerant of circumstances, and always being thoughtful in behaviour to avoid problems. Based on a preliminary survey conducted through the distribution of questionnaires to 30 teachers in 7 PGRI Vocational Schools in Bogor Regency, it was found that there were 41.7% of teachers who were not optimal in helping colleagues, 36.7% of teachers who were not optimal in their attitude to prevent problems, 35 % of teachers who were not yet optimal in their attitudes exceed the minimum requirements, 40% of teachers who were not optimal in tolerance to ideal conditions, and there were 35% of teachers who were not yet optimal in contributing to organizational progress. The results of the survey above indicate that teacher OCB still needs to be improved and given that teacher OCB is an important element related to achieving educational goals. Therefore, it was interested to conduct research. The purpose of the research is to produce optimal solutions for improving teacher OCB by finding the right way or strategy to enhance OCB by strengthening independent variables that positively affect teacher OCB. These variables are personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice. The optimal solution is then used as a recommendation to related parties, such as teachers, school principals, school supervisors, school organizing institutions and the education office.
Literature Review A. OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behaviour)
Dennis W. Organ [1] explains that OCB is a person's behaviour that is manifested of their own free will (voluntary), which cumulatively (as a whole) will support the effectiveness of organizational functions and that behaviour, either directly or explicitly, is not regulated by a reward system. The OCB indicators are 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Conscientiousness, and 4) Civic Virtue. Fred Luthans [2] argues that OCB are certain personality traits found in individuals, such as cooperation, helping and caring for others, and sincerity in work. OCB is built from five dimensions, which are 1) altruism, 2) conscientiousness, 3) civic virtue, 4) sportsmanship and 5) Courtesy. McShane and Von Glinow [3] define OCB as various forms of cooperation and helping others that support social organization and psychological contexts. The dimensions of OCB are 1) independent learning (self-learning), 2) social welfare participation, 3) maintaining interpersonal harmony at work, and 4) obeying the social norms that exist in society (fulfilment of social norms that exist in society). Behaviour is manifested in their own choice with the aim of organizational and personal interests. John M. Ivancevich [4] explains that OCB as the idea of expecting employees to work extra becomes important because service organizations continue to dominate economic growth. OCB indicators are: 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Compliance, 4) Civic Virtue, and 5) Sportsmanship. Bolino and Turnley [5] identified that organizations are able to produce employee behaviour that is not only focused on their duties. The indicators are 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, and 3). Sportsmanship, 4) Conscientiousness, and 5) Civic Virtue. Atika and Singh [6] conducted research on OCB. They found that OCB behaviour has two general characteristics such as not being directly regulated (technically not required as part of one's job), and representing specific or additional work required organization of its workforce to become successful people. Jennifer M. George [7] describes OCB as a behaviour that goes beyond the call of duty that is not determined by organizational members. This behaviour is essential for the survival and effectiveness of the organization. OCB is built from five dimensions, such as 1) civic virtue, 2) conscientiousness, 3) courtesy, and 4) sportsmanship. Kinicki et al, [8] stated that OCB is the behaviour of employees who indirectly do work that exceeds the requirements of the organization, such as 1) behaviour that builds and cares for the organization, individuals who like to help others, 2) behaviour of providing suggestions for organizational progress, 3) behaviour is willing to endure unpleasant circumstances without complaining, and attendance exceeds standards, 4) behaviour, directly or indirectly, doing work that exceeds the requirements set by the organization by raising awareness to care about the organization by helping colleagues, providing advice, and high loyalty which is characterized by a readiness to be willing to endure unpleasant circumstances. Colquitt et al, [9] suggested that OCB is an individual's voluntary behaviour that is not affected by the reward system that contributes to the organization. The indicators are 1) altruism, 2) courtesy, 3) sportsmanship, 4) voice, 5) civic virtue and 6) boosterism. Based on the theoretical study above, it can be synthesized that OCB is an individual behaviour that is manifested on their own volition (voluntary), which cumulatively (as a whole) will support the effectiveness of organizational functions, and these behaviours, either directly or indirectly, are explicit and not regulated by a reward system. It is also formal which

can be measured based on the following indicators: 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Conscientiousness, 4) Sportsmanship, and 5) Civic Virtue
B. Personality
Gibson et al. [10] stated that personality is a relatively stable set of characteristics, tendencies, and temperaments shaped by inheritance and by significant social, cultural and environmental factors. The dimensions of personality are conscientiousness, characterized by hard-working, persistent, organized, reliable, and persistent behaviour, and extraversion, which is the extent to which a person is sociable and assertive. According to Judge [11], personality is the organizational dynamics between the individual and the psychophysical system that determines the unique adjustment to the environment with indicators: 1) Conscientiousness, 2) Extraversion, 3) Agreeableness, 4) Emotional Stability, and 5) Openness to experience. Luthans [12] explains that personality is how a person influences others and how they understand and see themselves, as well as how to measure their outer and inner character, adjust the measurable inner and outer traits and interactions between situations, with indicators 1 ) Conscientiousness, 2) Extraversion, 3) Agreeableness, 4) Neuroticism, and 5) Openness to Experience. Hellriegel and Slocum [13] explain that a person's personality can be explained by a series of factors known as the Big Five Personality Factors which are specifically, personality factors that describe an individual's level of emotional stability, friendliness, self-disclosure, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Richard M. Ryckman [14] explains that personality is a dynamic organization that a person has, which uniquely influences cognition, motivation, and behaviour in various situations. Five personality dimensions include 1) conscientiousness, 2) extraversion, 3) agreeableness, 4 ) neuroticism and 5) openness to experience. Schermerhorn et al, [15] also explain that personality includes the overall combination of characteristics that captures a person's unique traits because the person reacts and interacts with other people. Personality combines a set of physical and mental characteristics that reflect how a person sees, thinks, acts and feels. Based on the descriptions that have been stated above, it can be synthesized that personality is the tendency in a person to explain the characteristics of behaviour patterns that are in accordance with the indicators, such as 1) Conscientiousness, 2) Extraversion, 3) Agreeableness, 4) neuroticism, and 5) openness to experience.
C. Interpersonal Communication
Anderson [16] explains that interpersonal communication is at the core of the organization because it creates a structure that then influences what else is said and done, and by whom those are done. Interpersonal communication takes place effectively, so there are several aspects that must be considered by the person such as 1. Openness, 2. Empathy, 3. Supportiveness, 4. Positiveness, 5. Equality. Schermerhon et al. [17] stated that communication is an interpersonal communication activity of the process of sending and receiving symbols in the form of messages achieved by them. This communication aims to convey messages quickly and briefly through personal symbols. There are four dimensions that affect interpersonal communication, such as self-image, the image of others, the physical environment and the social environment. Schermerhon et al. [18] explained that interpersonal communication in an organization is information that uses advanced technology and is supported by the continuous development of information technology. The communication context has four dimensions, such as physical, cultural, socio-psychological, and temporal dimensions. Daft [19] explains that interpersonal communication is difficult so it tends to avoid situations that require communication. There are three dimensions of context in the interpersonal communication process, which are the physical, social, psychological and temporal dimensions. McShane [20] suggested that interpersonal communication depends on the sender's ability to get the message across and the receiver's performance as an active listener. Interpersonal communication is communication between individuals. The success of the implementation of communication is strongly influenced by several factors, such as the selection of the type of information and factors related to the technique of delivering or transmitting data. Burleson [21] expressed his opinion that interpersonal communication refers to dyadic (two-way) communication in which two individuals share the roles of sender and receiver who are connected through mutually beneficial activities. The indicators are technical factors, behavioural factors, situational factors, time constraints and social status. John M Ivancevich et al. [22] explain that interpersonal communication is the delivery and receipt of information and understanding that flows from individual to individual in various ways, carried out face to face and in certain groups in the rapid delivery of messages. Several factors that influence interpersonal communication are trust, supportive behaviour and openness. Fred Luthans [23] explains that interpersonal communication is between communication media and technology on the one hand and nonverbal communication on the other because communication is a dynamic interpersonal process that includes behaviour change. Interpersonal communication emphasizes the transfer of information from one person to another, with indicators: self-image, the image of others, physical environment, social environment, physical condition and body language. Devito [24] argues that interpersonal communication is sending a message from a person and received by another person, or a group of people where the indicators are a. openness, b. empathy, c. support, d. positive feeling, and e. equivalence with immediate effect and feedback. Based on the description of the concept above, it can be synthesized that interpersonal communication is an activity of sending and receiving messages reciprocally carried out by individuals who have close relationships to achieve the desired goals in the organization with the indicators 1) Technical factors, 2) Openness, 3) Trusts, 4) Positiveness, and 5) Social status.

D. Organizational Justice
According to Robbins and Judge [25], organizational justice is the overall perception of fairness in the workplace. Organizational justice has 3 (three) forms, 1) distributive justice, 2) procedural justice, and 3) interactional justice. Schultz and Schultz [26] define organizational justice as the perception of how employees are treated fairly by the company by indicators of decreased job satisfaction, decreased organizational commitment, unfair conditions, high stress and looking for another job. Jerald Greenberg [27] Organizational justice is the science of people's perceptions and reactions to justice and injustice in organizations. While the indicators are: assigning tasks, dividing tasks, conducting performance appraisals, and determining salary increases, positions and honorariums. Ivancevich [28] explains that organizational justice is a field of organizational research that focuses on employees' perceptions and judgments about fairness in the processes and decision-making of the organizations to which they belong. The factors for the lack of fairness in the organization are unfair performance appraisal, opaque salary increase determination, and unfair promotions and rewards. George and Jones [29] claimed that organizational justice is employees' perception of overall fairness in their organization. Organizational justice is divided into 4 dimensions, such as 1) distributive justice, 2) procedural justice, 3) interpersonal justice, and 4) information justice. Organizational justice is divided into 4 dimensions, such as 1) distributive justice, 2) procedural justice, 3) interpersonal justice and 4) informational justice. Based on various previous explanations, it can be synthesized that organizational justice is a person's perception of an organization or leader in treating themselves fairly. The indicators of organizational justice are as follows: 1) Equality, 2) Needs, 3) Award for inspiration, 4) Consistency, 5) Ethics, 6) Pride, 7) Informative, and 8) Wisdom.
2. METHODOLOGY
As described above, this study aims to find ways to improve teachers' OCB through research on the strength of the relationship between OCB as the dependent variable and personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice as independent variables. The research method used a survey method with a correlational statistical approach to test statistical hypotheses and the SITOREM method for indicator analysis to determine the optimal solution for improving teacher OCB. The research constellation of the variables studied and their indicators are as follows:

The study was conducted on teachers of SMK PGRI in Bogor Regency with a population of 289 teachers, with a sample of 168 teachers calculated using the Slovin formula taken from Umar [30]. Data collection in this study used a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire distributed to teachers. The research instrument items were derived from the research indicators that would be explored in the situation. Before being distributed to respondents, the research instrument was first tested for validity and reliability [31]. The validity test was carried out using the Pearson Product Moment technique, while the reliability test used calculations using Cronbach's Alpha formula After the data was collected, the homogeneity test, normality test, linearity test, simple correlation analysis, coefficient of determination analysis, partial correlation analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing were carried out. Furthermore, an analysis of indicators is carried out using the SITOREM method from Hardhienata [32] to determine the order of priority for the improvement of indicators as a recommendation to related parties which is the result of this study. In determining the order of priority for handling indicators, SITOREM uses three criteria, which are (1) the strength of the relationship between variables obtained from hypothesis testing, (2) the priority order for handling indicators resulting from expert assessments, and (3) the value of indicators obtained from the calculation results of the data obtained from the answers of respondents.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION A. The relation between personality and OCB
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a very significant positive relationship between personality and OCB, with a correlation coefficient of 0.603 and a coefficient of determination of 0.073. This means that the higher the personality, the higher the OCB. The implication is that if you want to improve OCB, you need to strengthen your personality.. Experiential assessment related to the priority of personality variable indicators by considering cost, benefit, urgency, and urgency factors produces indicators that are in good condition so that they are maintained or developed, which are 1) Courtesy, 2) Civic virtue, 3) Conscientiousness, 4) Sportsmanship, and 5) Altruism.
Figure 2. The results of Indicators Weighting and Personality Indicator Scores B. The relation between interpersonal communication with OCB
The data processing results through statistical hypothesis testing indicate a very significant positive relationship between interpersonal communication and OCB, with a correlation coefficient of 0.518 and a coefficient of determination of 0.061. This means that the higher the interpersonal communication, the higher the OCB. The implication is that if OCB is to be improved, it is necessary to strengthen Interpersonal Communication. The experimental assessment related to the priority of personality variable indicators by considering the cost, benefit, urgency, and urgency factors resulted in a priority order for handling trust firstly, and secondly Openness. While indicators that were in good condition to maintain or develop were 1) Positive, 2) Technical Factors, and 3) Social Status.

C. The relation between justice organizational with OCB
The data processing results through statistical hypothesis testing indicate a very significant positive relationship between organizational justice and OCB, with a correlation coefficient of 0.512 and a coefficient of determination of 0.047. This means that the higher the organizational justice, the higher the OCB. The implication is that if OCB is to be improved, it is necessary to strengthen Organizational Justice. Experimental assessment related to the priority of personality variable indicators by considering the factors of cost, benefit, importance, and urgency resulted in the priority order of handling as follows: first is an award for inspiration and second is needs. While indicators that are in good condition so that they are maintained or developed are 1) Wisdom, 2) Equility, 3) Consistency, 4) Ethics, 5) Informative, and 6) Pride

4. CONCLUSION
From the discussion described above, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. There is a positive relationship between personality and teacher OCB with a correlation coefficient of 0.603 so that personality strengthening can increase teacher OCB. 2. There is a positive relationship between interpersonal communication and teacher OCB with a correlation coefficient of 0.518 so that personality strengthening can increase teacher OCB. 3. There is a positive relationship between organizational justice and teacher OCB with a correlation coefficient of 0.512 so that personality strengthening can increase teacher OCB. The implication of the conclusion above is, if teachers' OCB is to be improved, it is necessary to strengthen personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice. From the results of the SITOREM analysis, the optimal solution is obtained as follows: 1. The priority order of indicators for handling personality strengthening, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice is as follows: 1st Trust, 2nd Openness, 3rd Award for Inspiration, 4th Need, 5th Courtesy, 6th Civic Virtue, 7th Conscientiousness, 8th Sportsmanship, and 9th Altruism. 2. Indicators in proper condition that are maintained or developed are as follows: 1) Positiveness, 2) Technical Factor, 3) Social Status, 4) Agreeableness, 5) Extraversion, 6) Openness to experience, 7) Neuroticism, 8 ) Conscientiousness, 9) Wisdom, 10) Equility, 11) Consistency, 12) Ethics, 13) Informative, and 14) Pride. Suggestions or recommendations that can be given to related parties are as follows: 1. Teachers need to improve OCB by strengthening personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice by increasing Trust, Openness, Appreciation for Inspiration, Necessity, Politeness, Virtue, Prudence, Sportsmanship, and Altruism. 2. Principals, school supervisors, school managers and education offices need to foster teachers in improving OCB by providing appropriate directions to strengthen personality, interpersonal communication, and organizational justice according to the results of this study.

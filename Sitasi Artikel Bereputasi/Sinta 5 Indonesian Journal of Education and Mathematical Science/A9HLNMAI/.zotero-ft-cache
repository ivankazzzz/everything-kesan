Teaching material, Information and Technology, Islamic Education
The research was conducted to analyze the information and communication technology utilization in MAS Islamiyah Sunggal during the learning process. The researcher found the results of the study that the MAS Islamiyah Sunggal school did not optimally use information and communication technology as a medium of teaching materials in the teaching and learning process with the limitations of the projector and the effectiveness of the old method with question and answer, discussion and problem-solving strategies, as well as prayer practice which does not require technology in practice. Because each teacher has their own plan of teaching and learning process, the school only provides facilities with 25 computers, 1 projector, and an LCD projector, which are used alternately by each class at MAS Islamiyah Sunggal.

1. INTRODUCTION
The information revolution has changed the world's communication system today. The distribution of information through networks stored on the internet proves that now the world is getting smaller--indicating that there are no more geographical boundaries that prevent us from interacting with the global world. The flow of globalization has given rise to a new perspective on education. The educational strategy from conventional face-to-face teaching changes into more various methods. Information networks that enable interaction and collaboration will further optimise future education. The utilization of information networks has proven its benefits for the community. Thus, the influence of globalization has changed our education so that it is more networked, open and interactive, diverse, multidisciplinary, and work productivity oriented. Changes and progress of the nation are always inspired and driven. This nation is independent because of the emergence of superior individuals. However, it is not enough if teachers only equip themselves with their professional abilities, but must be followed noble morals as well as teaching materials and other supporting media. Professor of education science Ahmad Tafsir stated that the essence of education includes two aspects, first to help, second to help. The first aspect helps a person become a complete human being, meaning that humans can control themselves and have good morals (ethics). The second aspect is helping humans to become humans. This means directing humans to do the right thing does not lead to disgraceful actions and unethical actions. Education is a process that helps grow, develop, mature, and make that which is disorderly or wild become more orderly, a kind of process of creating a culture and order in oneself and in others. Education also means the process of developing various kinds of potential that exist in humans, such as academic, rational, talent, physical abilities, or artistic abilities. Education can also be interpreted as a process or conscious effort to make humans in a better direction. School is an educational institution, which has certain functions and goals and general goals. While the functions and objectives of education mentioned in Law Number 20 of 2003 concerning the National education system Chapter II Article 3 namely: "Developing dignified national character and civilization abilities in the framework of educating the nation's life, aims to develop the potential of students so that they become good human beings. believe in and fear the Almighty God, have a noble character, be healthy, knowledgeable and capable, creative, independent, and become democratic and responsible citizens”. Islamic education is directed at the introduction, understanding and appreciation as well as practice of Islamic teachings which emphasize balance, and harmony in human relations with Allah SWT, humans with humans and human relations with their environment in accordance with the Al-Qur'an and Sunnah as a guide to life that is inherited by Allah SWT through Rasulullah SAW to the human beings. Islamic education means education that is natural. Natural Islamic education contains meaning, a concept of values that are universal in accordance with Islamic teachings themselves. This universal value is marked by the teachings of Islam itself. This universal value is marked by the characteristics of being fair, righteous, disciplined, egalitarian, open, dynamic and so on--the implementation of which is exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. The purpose of Islamic education is a process to form human beings who serve Allah SWT to be intelligent, skilled, have a noble character, and is responsible towards themselves and society in order to achieve happiness in the afterlife. In fact, the Al-Qur'an and Hadith as the main sources of education and basic concepts in Islamic education, are very concerned about humans and see them as a whole without a dichotomy view between the material and the non-material. Concrete evidence that Islamic education based on the Qur'an is very concerned about the development of nature and the development of human life and human nature itself. Therefore education is very important for the struggle for life and maintaining human existence, it seems to be the most important, because education is a cultural heritage, what distinguishes humans from animals is culture and reason. Technology is rapidly developing in this sophisticated era. The development of information and communication technology is increasing and its impact on education is inevitable. Education is a conscious and planned effort to create a learning atmosphere and learning process so that students actively develop their potential to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intelligence, noble character, and the skills they need so they are not left behind in terms of expertise in this current era of development especially in science, society, nation and state. The use of technology is familiar in globalization. In the education sector—the place where technology has emerged—it is normal to utilize technology to ease the learning process. From here, the term educational technology emerged. Educational technology is a systemic method for planning, using and evaluating all teaching and learning activities by taking into account both technical and human resources and the interaction between the two, so as to obtain a more effective form of education. Yusuf stated that educational technology is a systemic process in helping to solve learning problems, so it can be said that technology is used as a support for successful learning. Global demands require the world of education to always adjust the development of information and communication technology to improve the quality of education, especially the adjustment of the use of information and communication technology to the world of education, especially in the learning process. In the learning process, there is one component that supports the success of the learning process, such as teaching materials. Teaching materials are all forms of materials used by an educator in the learning process in order to achieve complete competence. In addition to educators, there are also important things to realize the success of the learning process such as adequate teaching materials. A teacher is not professional if they teach without using the teaching materials designed by themselves. According to Dr. Wina Sanjaya, teaching materials are everything that becomes the content of the curriculum that must be mastered by students in accordance with basic competencies in order to achieve competency standards for each subject in a particular educational unit. In the learning process, the position of teaching materials is very important because

of the expected benefits for educators and teaching materials, such as saving teaching time, placing educators as facilitators and creating a more efficient and interactive learning atmosphere. Based on this, the same expectation is in the subject of Islamic Religious Education. Students are expected to be able to understand the material well therefore students can apply it in their daily life and can live up to the values as well as the ideals of Islam. The objective of Islamic education also can be achieved by instilling faith and piety in students and making generations of good morals. However, in practice and the learning process, it does not necessarily easily achieve its learning objectives, because in fact sometimes students are not so enthusiastic about learning. Many students do not pay serious attention to lessons, and even fall asleep during the teaching and learning process. Most are also bored during lessons, so most students do not understand the content of the material being taught properly, as a result, students do not fully appreciate the lessons delivered and the learning process becomes less effective. Some of the problems in the learning process are certainly inseparable from various causes, including the low interest of students in studying Islamic education. It is considered unpleasant because Islamic religious education contains a lot of material so it requires a process called reading as in Tohirin's book, entitled ''Psychology of learning Islamic religious education''. The research says that currently, the interest in reading in Indonesian society is still low as evidenced by the statement of the Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture Puan Maharani who stated that the average Indonesian only reads about 30-59 minutes per day, while the number of books completed only 5-9 books per year. This is based on a 2017 national library research. From the explanation above, we can understand that a stimulus is needed that can arouse students' enthusiasm and motivation with interesting learning methods, teaching materials and creative learning media in accordance with the times, which can make students curious and innovative in the development of students' talent and creativity. Today, along with the times, technology is also developing so rapidly, everything can be accessed easily. In order to balance this progress towards education, in this case, Islamic education, it is very necessary to develop both in terms of packaging and presentation of teaching materials, methods, methods of delivering material, and learning media. Furthermore, teachers should also be more creative in following developments in the world of students as technology develops swiftly, so students will be more enthusiastic and motivated to learn. Related to the Islamic Education learning in MA Islamiyah Sunggal that the researchers observed, both teachers and students have carried out the teaching and learning process well. The teacher has used several learning methods and students have also taken lessons seriously, but there are still some students who look sleepy in participating in the teaching and learning process and also talking to their friends when the lesson was taking place. This was based on preliminary observations from researchers on the subject of Islamic education at MA Islamiyah Sunggal. Besides these problems, as for the facilities provided at the school, it is proven that facilities such as LCD projectors have been available but are not in accordance with existing needs, resulting in the ineffective application of technology in MA Islamic schools. MA Islamiyah Sunggal does not use the application of technology in the teaching and learning process by superior individuals in various professions and fields of life.
2. METHODOLOGY
This research was conducted at MA Islamiyah Sunggal with a qualitative case study method. The purpose of this research method is to describe in full and in-depth the application of teaching materials for Islamic education subjects based on information technology. The data collection techniques used in this study were 1) Library research by finding and collecting existing teaching material formats, 2) Interviews by conducting question and answer sessions with several sources considered competent such as school principals, Islamic education subject teachers and several 3rd-grade high school students, 3) Observations that the researcher made direct observations at the research location with the aim of finding sources of supporting data, 4) Documentation, by carrying out some documentation retrieval to corroborate the results of the research. The data obtained directly by the researcher can be divided into two data sources, such as primary data and secondary data. The primary data obtained from the results of direct interviews compiled related to the research objectives. Secondary data was obtained by researchers from several data sources including library research, observation, and documentation. The data analysis technique carried out by the researcher followed the recommended steps, such as source triangulation, technical triangulation and time triangulation.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION A. The Analysis of Information Technology-Based Teaching Materials in Islamic Education at MA Islamiyah Sunggal a. The Availability of Technological Facilities and Infrastructure at MA Islamiyah Sunggal
In the process of teaching and learning, there is something called teaching materials. Teaching materials are all materials (tool information and text) that are systematically arranged, which display a complete figure of the competencies that will be mastered by students and used in the learning process with the aim of planning and studying the implementation of learning. The teaching materials used in learning Islamic Education at MA Islamiyah Sunggal are in the form of teaching materials using textbooks. This results in the less effective use of teaching materials due to the limited tools to convey teaching materials to students based on observations from researchers. This was reinforced by a statement from Mr AH, one of the management at the MA Islamiyah Sunggal school. The researcher asked Mr AH about the availability of information and communication technology facilities and infrastructure provided by the school during the teaching and learning process. He explained in an interview conducted by the researcher that: "The learning method at school still uses conventional methods in which the delivery of teaching materials only uses textbooks. As well as the use of technology such as LCD projectors, power points, and other media is not optimal

due to the lack of facilities and infrastructure for the use of teaching materials, this is based on limited facilities. However, the students at MA Islamiyah Sunggal cannot carry out learning using technology to the fullest. Therefore, teachers only carry out the learning process conventionally, we provide computers if teachers need them to be used for students as learning media to better understand science with technological sophistication, but back to the teachers, each has its own method of learning. The researcher asked one of the teachers at MAS Islamiyah Sunggal about the availability of information and communication technology facilities and infrastructure provided by the school during the teaching and learning process, he said that: "We teach by referring to the curriculum. Before conducting online learning, we need to check the curriculum first because we make and develop a lesson plan based on the curriculum. Therefore, the teaching material must be in accordance with the teaching curriculum every year. Usually, in face-to-face meetings, the methods vary, later on, there will be an inquiry to solve a problem, and later on, group work, lectures, questions and answers, and assignments may be online before we meet face-to-face. Because in the past few months we have met face to face, so each teacher's method has varied because we have limited it. We have one infocus in the office, and most teachers, if they want to use infocus, go to this room (office), because of limited facilities. If it's from social media like YouTube, we send it to the groups of each class, according to learning. So each teacher has a study group, and then students access it via their own handphones, or even power points are also available during online learning after Covid 19 ago. Based on the actual explanation of the material that is easy for students to understand with infocus and explanation--because they get not only hearing but seeing it immediately, makes them better at recall, understand better and are more familiar with the material itself. I immediately gave an example of what was being taught, for instance, a lesson about the Day of Judgment, by making the slides of the presentation. They immediately saw and listened so they understood more about the descriptions of the Day of Judgment and the verses that explain the Day of Judgment. Therefore I designed my own lesson plan as well as the teachers here. So during the pandemic, we mostly sent videos and were asked to conclude and adapt the verses according to the learning material. The learning was sometimes also via zoom. They also looked for other sources such as links and then collected the assignments given by the teacher through online class groups. online. In the beginning, the first problem was the students did not do the assignment because the learning was not conducted face-toface. For instance, they did not complete their notes before the exam. Therefore, at first, we have to introduce ourselves to each other to make it familiar between teachers and students." Based on the results, the facilities provided by the school is a projector with a limited number of. The teachers used PowerPoint, and Youtube videos adapting the situation in the Covid-19 pandemic with the online learning method through handphone. The teachers also gave the assignments online. When the new normal begins to apply, the teacher adapts to the circumstances of face-to-face learning so that it is more effective to see the development of student understanding. a. The Application of Existing Technology at MA Islamiyah Sunggal
The researcher asked Mr AH about the application of technology carried out at the MA Islamiyah Sunggal school. He answered: "During a pandemic, online learning is conducted through WA or e-learning, which in fact, it is not efficient. However, we must apply it. Even in conventional learning, they have to achieve at least 82%. If they do not reach that, they will be left behind. But now, even though some of them already have offline, it's more efficient because you can directly practice using learning methods according to the needs of the students. The teacher uses several methods such as question and answers, discussion, and praying practice. For example, the practice of Duha praying is obligatory. The methods vary depending on the teachers. However, it is better to use technology in every topic or material even though it is not compulsory. Compared to online learning, the efficiency reaches 80% in conventional learning. Conventional is more efficient because we directly meet face-to-face. Usually, people's views on conventional only talk about materials, materials and materials, and don't know what the goals are, whereas on YouTube we know the illustration of how and what was done. However, if you look at YouTube, children become lazy and can't focus, whatever the story, if that method is used, the conventional method is more efficient, because it's based on my experience. And almost 90% of teachers at this school are ready for technology, and it is mandatory for teachers to understand technology, however, not all learning has to be done with technology but a combination of conventional and technology will be much more effective and efficient. Based on the results of an interview with Mr AH that the application of using technology in the teaching and learning process at MAS Islamiyah Sunggal was not optimal, it was not based on limited human resources but based on the ineffectiveness of teaching materials using media without direct supervision. This happened during the Covid 19 pandemic in which students are lazy to learn because of virtual.

Before the learning process ends, the teacher must conclude and unify students' understanding of what they have presented and explained. This activity serves to correct students' wrong understanding. The teacher must also provide advice and motivation for students, therefore, they do not only understand the material up to the theory but also apply it in real life.

DISCUSSION
MAS Islamiyah Sunggal school provides technological facilities as a medium of teaching materials to make it easier for students and teachers during the teaching and learning process, such as the provision of 25 units of computers, infocus, LCD, and projectors that can be used by teachers according to a predetermined schedule and used alternately with other classes. The availability of the facilities provided is used by teachers according to the needs of the teaching materials they summarize in the design of implementing learning with various methods. Not all of the material explained must use technology so the existing facilities are not utilised optimally by teachers. This is not because the teachers of the MAS Islamiyah Sunggal school are unable to use technology but are less efficient in using technology for students so teachers are more dominant in using the old way or conventional methods in the teaching and learning process. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the condition of the MAS Islamiyah Sunggal teachers, they used technology to carry out learning so most students did not participate in learning optimally because they were not monitored directly. As a result, before the exam, the requirements for taking the exam were by collecting notes but most students did not complete their notes.
4. CONCLUSION
Based on the results of research on the Analysis of Information Technology-Based Teaching Materials in Islamic Subjects at MA Islamiyah Sunggal Sumatera Utara, it is concluded that: 1. Availability of technological facilities and infrastructure at MA Islamiyah Sunggal in the form of availability of computers, LCD projectors, PowerPoint utilisation, YouTube, WhatsApp as media for teaching materials that are used but not optimally and prioritising conventional methods, such as by taking notes and explaining them, which are considered more effective and efficient. 2. The application of existing technology at the MA Islamiyah Sunggal uses a projector more often to display power points, and then students record material that will be explained by the teacher with a combination of existing technology and conventional methods. This will make learning more memorable to students than delivering the material without being recorded and or only distributing learning material via WhatsApp in the form of PowerPoint and explained.

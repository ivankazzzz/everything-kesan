ABSTRACT
In educational organizations, teachers are at the heart of the management element. Teachers who successfully carry out their main duties as described in their job descriptions, coupled with an awareness of doing something extra, are key to the success of the organization. Extra activities that are not directly related to the prevailing formal reward system are called OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behavior). Based on preliminary research, it is known that PGRI Vocational High School teachers in Bogor Regency have relatively low OCB. Therefore, research is needed to obtain information on variables related to increasing OCB. The purpose of this study is to make efforts to increase teachers' OCB by conducting research on the relationship between personality variables, interpersonal communication and organizational justice. This study used correlational statistical analysis method to determine the relationship between the variables studied and SITOREM method for indicator analysis to obtain optimal solutions in efforts to increase teachers' OCB. The research population was 289 teachers from PGRI Vocational High School in Bogor Regency. From this population, a sample was then taken using the Slovin formula to obtain a sample of 168 people. The results of the analysis using the correlation method show that there is a positive relationship between personality and O CB with a correlation coefficient of ρy1 = 0.416, so that strengthening personality can increase OCB. There is a positive relationship between interpersonal communication and OCB with a correlation coefficient of ρy2 = 0.526, so strengthening interpersonal communication can increase OCB. There is a positive relationship between organizational justice and OCB with a correlation coefficient of ρy3 = 0.417, so strengthening organizational justice can increase OCB. From the SITOREM analysis, the optimal solution is that out of 23 indicators, 14 indicators are well developed, so they w ill be maintained or developed, and there are 9 indicators that are still weak, so they need to be improved. The improvement of the weak indicators is also prioritised. The indicators that are already good are: 1) Supportive behaviour, 2) Technical factors, 3) Social status, 4) Friendliness, 5) Self-extraversion, 6) Openness to experience, 7) Emotional stability, 8) Prudence, 9) Wisdom, 10) Equality, 11) Consistency, 12) Ethical, 13) Informative, and 14) Self-esteem, and the indicators that need to be improved in order of priority of treatment are as follows: 1) trust, 2) openness, 3) respect for inspiration, 4) necessity, 5) politeness, 6) civic virtue, 7) conscientiousness, 8) sportsmanship and 9) altruism.

1. INTRODUCTION
Human resources in educational organizations play a strategic role, based on the belief that individuals are the formulators of organizational goals and at the same time the main drivers to achieve goals. Each individual in the organization has a duty to perform basic tasks in accordance with their responsibilities, and as citizens of the organization, individuals also have a duty to work together as a team to achieve organizational goals. Such behavior is called OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behavior) in modern management. A good OCB is the behavior of teachers who are able to carry out the main tasks as stated in the job description, coupled with the awareness of doing something that they believe can accelerate the achievement of organizational goals, which is shown through behaviors such as: helping colleagues, being

involved in the organisational structure of schools and professional organisations, being tolerant of the situation and always being careful in their behaviour so as not to cause problems. Based on a preliminary survey conducted by distributing questionnaires to 30 teachers in 6 (six) PGRI Vocational High Schools (SMK) in Bogor Regency, data obtained that there are 41.7% of teachers who are not optimal in helping colleagues (Alturism), There are 36.7% of teachers who are not optimal in preventing problems (Courtesy), There are 35% of teachers who are not optimal in exceeding minimum requirements (Conscientiousness). There are 40% of teachers who have not been optimal in tolerating less than ideal conditions (Sportsmanship), 35% of teachers have not been optimal in contributing to the progress of the organisation or (Civic Virtue). The above survey results show that teachers' OCB still needs to be improved, and considering that teachers' OCB is an important element related to the achievement of educational goals, this OCB is interesting to study. The purpose of the study is to produce an optimal solution in improving teachers' OCB by finding the right way or strategy to increase OCB, namely by strengthening the independent variables that have a positive effect on teachers' OCB. These variables are personality, interpersonal communication and organisational justice. The optimal solution found will then be used as a recommendation to related parties, that is, teachers, principals, school supervisors, school management institutions and educational agencies.
Literature Review A. OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behavior)
Dennis W. Organ [1] states that OCB is a person's behavior that is self-initiated (voluntary), that cumulatively (as a whole) supports the effectiveness of organizational functions, and that behaviour is not directly or explicitly regulated by the formal reward system in place in the organization. The indicators of OCB are: 1) altruism, 2) courtesy, 3) conscientiousness, 4) citizenship. Fred Luthans [2] suggests that OCB is certain personality characteristics (traits) contained in individuals, namely cooperative traits, like to help and care for others, and seriousness of work. OCB consists of five dimensions, which are 1) altruism, 2) conscientiousness, 3) citizenship, 4) sportsmanship, and 5) courtesy. McShane and Von Glinow [3] define OCB as various forms of cooperation and helping others that support social organizations and psychological contexts. The dimensions of OCB are: 1) self-learning, 2) participation in social welfare, 3) maintaining interpersonal harmony at work, and 4) compliance with social norms that exist in society. Behavior that is manifested by one's own decisions with the aim of organizational and personal interests. John M. Ivancevich [4] explains that OCB, as the idea of expecting employees to go the extra mile, has become important as service organizations continue to dominate economic growth. The indicators of OCB are: 1) Alturism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Compliance, 4) Civic Virtue and 5) Sportsmanship. Bolino and Turnley [5] found that organizations are able to create employee behavior that is not just task focused. The indicators are: 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Sportsmanship, 4) Conscientiousness and 5) Civic Virtue. Atika and Singh [6] conducted research on OCB and found that OCB behaviors have two common characteristics, namely: these actions are not directly regulated (technically not required as part of one's job), and these actions represent special or extra work that organizations need from their employees in order to be successful. Jennifer M. George [7] describes OCB as behavior that goes beyond the call of duty, that is not determined by the members of the organization, and that is important for the survival and effectiveness of the organization. OCB consists of five dimensions, namely 1) Civic Virtue, 2) Conscientiousness, 3) Courtesy, and 4) Sportsmanship.

Kinicki et al, [8] stated that OCB is the behavior of employees who indirectly perform work beyond what is required by the organization, such as: 1) Behavior that builds and cares for the organization, a person who likes to help others, 2) Behavior that provides suggestions for the progress of the organization, 3) Behavior that is willing to endure unpleasant circumstances without complaining and attendance above standards. 4) Behavior of directly or indirectly doing work beyond the requirements set by the organization by promoting awareness of caring for the organization by helping colleagues, making suggestions, and high loyalty is characterized by willingness to endure unpleasant circumstances. Colquitt et al, [9] suggested that OCB is the voluntary behavior of individuals who are not influenced by the reward system and who contribute to the organization. The indicators are: 1) Altruism, 2) Courtesy, 3) Sportsmanship, 4) Voice, 5) Civic Virtue and 6) Boosterism. Based on the theoretical study above, it can be summarized that OCB is individual behavior that is manifested on its own accord (voluntary), which cumulatively (as a whole) supports the effectiveness of organizational functions, and this behavior is not regulated, either directly or explicitly, by the applicable formal reward system, which can be measured based on indicators: 1) altruism, 2) courtesy, 3) conscientiousness, 4) sportsmanship, and 5) civic virtue.
B. Personality
Gibson et al, [10] Personality is a set of relatively stable characteristics, tendencies and temperaments that are shaped by heredity and by significant social, cultural and environmental factors. The dimensions of personality are: conscientiousness, which is characterized by a person's hard working, diligent, organised, reliable and persistent behavior; extraversion, which is the extent to which a person is sociable, gregarious and assertive versus quiet, calm and shy, friendly. Robbins and Judge [11] Personality is the organizational dynamics between within the individual and the psychophysical systems that determine unique adaptations to their environment with indicators: 1) conscientiousness, 2) extraversion, 3) agreeableness, 4) emotional stability and 5) openness to experience. Luthans [12] explains that personality is how a person affects others and how they understand and see themselves, as well as how their internal and external character is measured, measuring internal and external measurable traits and interactions between situations with indicators: 1) conscientiousness, 2) extraversion, 3) agreeableness, 4) neuroticism, and 5) openness to experience. Hellriegel and Slocum [13] explain that individual personality can be described by a set of factors known as the Big Five personality factors. Specifically, the personality factors describe an individual's level of emotional stability, sociability, openness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Richard M. Ryckman [14] explains that Personality is the dynamic organisation that a person possesses that uniquely influences cognition, motivation, and behaviour in different situations.The five dimensions of personality include: 1) conscientiousness, 2) extraversion, 3) agreeableness, 4) neuroticism, 5) openness to experience. Schermerhorn et al, [15] also explained that personality is an overall combination of characteristics that capture the unique nature of a person as that person reacts and interacts with others. Personality combines a set of physical and mental characteristics that reflect how a person sees, thinks, acts and feels. Based on the above descriptions, it can be summarized that personality is a tendency within a person to explain the characteristics of their consistent behavior patterns with indicators, which are 1) conscientiousness, 2) extraversion, 3) agreeableness, 4) neuroticism, and 5) openness to experience.
C. Interpersonal Communication
According to Anderson [16], interpersonal communication is at the heart of the organisation because it creates a structure that then influences what else is said and done and by whom. In order for interpersonal


Indonesian Journal of Education & Mathematical Science Vol. 4, No. 3, September 2023, pp. 159~169 ISSN: 2721-3838, DOI: 10.30596/ ijems.v4i3.16840
162
communication to be effective, there are several aspects that need to be considered by those involved in interpersonal communication, namely 1. Openness, 2. Empathy, 3. Supportiveness, positive, 5. Equality. Schermerhon et al [17] communication is an interpersonal communication activity in the form of a process of sending and receiving symbols in the form of messages achieved by them. This communication aims to convey messages quickly and briefly through symbols in person, there are four dimensions that affect interpersonal communication, namely self-image, the image of the other party, the physical environment and the social environment. Schermerhon et al [18] explained that interpersonal communication in organizations is information that uses sophisticated technology and is supported by continuous developments in information technology. The communication context has four dimensions, namely physical, cultural, socio-psychological and temporal dimensions. McShane [20] suggests that interpersonal communication depends on the sender's ability to get the message across and the receiver's performance as an active listener. The successful implementation of communication is strongly influenced by several factors, namely the factor of selecting the type of information and factors related to the technique of delivering or sending data. Burleson [21] argued that interpersonal communication refers to dyadic (two-way) communication in which two individuals share the role of sender and receiver who are connected by mutually beneficial activities. The indicators are: technical factors, behavioral factors, situational factors, time constraints and psychological distance/social status. John M Ivancevich et al [22] say that interpersonal communication is the delivery and receipt of information and understanding that flows from one individual to another in a variety of ways, carried out face to face and in a particular group in the delivery of messages quickly. Some factors that influence interpersonal communication are: trust, supportive behavior and open attitudes. Fred Luthans [23] explains that interpersonal communication is between communication media and technology on the one hand and non-verbal communication on the other. Communication is a dynamic interpersonal process involving behavior change. Interpersonal communication emphasizes the transfer of information from one person to another, with indicators: self-image, image of others, physical environment, social environment, physical condition and body language. Devito [24] suggests that interpersonal communication is the sending of messages by one person and the receiving of messages by another person or group of people, where the indicators are: a. openness, b. empathy, c. support, d. positive feelings, and e. equality with direct effects and feedback. Based on the description of the concept above, it can be synthesized that interpersonal communication is an activity of sending and receiving messages reciprocally carried out by individuals who have a close relationship to achieve the desired goals in the organization with indicators 1). Technical factor, 2). Openness, 3). Trust, 4). Positivity and 5). Social status.
D. Organizational Justices
Robbins and Judge [25] Organisational justice is the total perception of justice in the workplace. Organisational justice has 3 (three) forms, namely: 1). distributive justice, 2). procedural justice, and 3). interactional justice. Schultz and Schultz [26] defined organizational justice as the perception of how fairly employees are treated by the organization. With indicators: lower job satisfaction, lower organizational commitment, unfair conditions, high stress and looking for another job. Jerald Greenberg [27] organizational justice is the science of people's perceptions and reactions to justice and injustice in organizations. The indicators are: assignment of tasks, distribution of tasks, performance appraisal, and determination of pay increases, positions and rewards.

Ivancevich [28] explains that organizational justice is an area of organizational research that focuses on employees' perceptions and evaluations of the fairness of the processes and decisions of the organization to which they belong. The factors of lack of justice in the organization are: performance appraisal is not done fairly, setting salary increases that are not transparent, unfair promotions and rewards. George and Jones [29] Organizational justice is the employee's perception of the overall fairness in their organization. Organizational justice is divided into 4 dimensions, namely 1). Distributive justice, 2). Procedural justice, 3). Interpersonal justice, and 4). Informational justice. Organizational justice is divided into 4 dimensions, such as 1) distributive justice, 2) procedural justice, 3) interpersonal justice and 4) informational justice. Based on various previous explanations, it can be summarized that organizational justice is a person's perception that the organization or leader treats them fairly. Indicators of organizational justice are: 1) equality, 2) needs, 3) reward for inspiration, 4) consistency, 5) ethics, 6) pride, 7) information and 8) wisdom.
2. RESEARCH METHOD
As described above, this study aims to find ways to improve teachers' OCB by exploring the strength of the relationship between OCB as the dependent variable and personality, interpersonal communication and organizational justice as the independent variables. The research method used is the survey method with a correlational statistical approach to test statistical hypotheses and the SITOREM method for indicator analysis to determine the optimal solution for improving teachers' OCB. The research constellation of the variables studied and their indicators is as follows

The research was conducted on teachers of PGRI Vocational High School in Bogor Regency with a population of 289 teachers, with a sample of 168 teachers calculated using the Slovin formula taken from Umar [30]. Data collection in this study used research instruments in the form of questionnaires distributed to teachers as research respondents. The items of the research instrument are derived from the research indicators to be studied. Before the research instrument was distributed to the respondents, it was first tested to determine its validity and reliability [31]. The validity test was carried out using the Pearson Product Moment technique, while the reliability test was calculated using the Cronbach Alpha formula. After data collection, homogeneity test, normality test, linearity test, simple correlation analysis, coefficient of determination analysis, partial correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing were carried out. In addition, the indicators were analyzed using Hardhienata's SITOREM method [32] to determine the priority order for improving the indicators as a recommendation to the stakeholders resulting from this research. SITOREM uses three criteria to determine the order of priority for dealing with indicators, namely (1) the strength of the relationship between variables obtained from hypothesis testing, (2) the order of priority for dealing with indicators obtained from expert judgment, and (3) the value of the indicators obtained from data calculations based on the responses of research participants.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Relationship between Personality and OCB
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a very significant positive relationship between personality and OCB, with a correlation coefficient of 0.416 and a coefficient of determination of 0.093. This means that the higher the personality, the higher the OCB. The implication is that in order to increase OCB, it is necessary to increase personality.

B. Relationship between Interpersonal Communication and OCB
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a very significant positive relationship between interpersonal communication and OCB, with a correlation coefficient of 0.526 and a coefficient of determination of 0.161. This means that the higher the interpersonal communication, the higher the OCB. The implication is that if OCB is to be improved, it is necessary to strengthen interpersonal communication. The experts' assessment of the priority of the indicators of personality variables, taking into account the factors of cost, benefit, importance and urgency, resulted in the following order of priority treatment 1) trust and 2) openness, while indicators that are already in a good condition to be maintained or developed are 1) dominance, 2) technical factor and 3) social status.

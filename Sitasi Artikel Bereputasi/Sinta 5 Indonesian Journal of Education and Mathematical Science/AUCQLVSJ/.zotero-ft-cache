1. INTRODUCTION
In this era, it is undeniable that English is not only used as a second language used in every country, predominantly Asia, but English is also now used as a language that can be used to deliver things to foreign countries. Not much different from Indonesia, Thailand also makes English a second language besides the language of its own country. The English language skills of Indonesian and Thai citizens are just not very good, in contrast to the Philippines, which is more developing English for every citizen of every layer so they can speak English well. It often happens when schools in Thailand teach English without teaching speaking skills, and we wonder why many Thais are embarrassed to speak English. Speaking is an essential English skill. In teaching, they need to be motivated, but they need to be involved in every class activity that encourages them to learn as long as they find it fun because students are considered to have less motivation. Therefore, here the teacher's role is very important because it guides students to enjoy and creates fun learning so that students remain motivated to learn. According to Guidanceforal (2019) states that perception is a process of sensory clues (sensory) from relevant past experiences organized to give us a structured and meaningful picture of a particular situation. In terms of perception, there are two crucial elements, namely interpretation and organization. Interpretation is an effort to understand the individual's information obtained. Meanwhile, the organization is in the process of managing certain information so that it has meaning. Perceptions of teachers are used to measure the framework of the overall learning process and the performance of the teachers themselves, especially in early childhood students. Here the teacher must create and introduce this atmosphere and provide material according to the needs of the material objectives and students. Therefore, the teacher's perspective is needed to bring up learning materials and processes suitable for teaching students, especially young learners. Based on the situation presented above, this research conducts research on the need to teach English as a Foreign Language in Thailand, where the researcher becomes an apprentice Teacher at Thammislam Foundation School. An elementary school English Teacher to fulfill the goal of mastering English as a Foreign Language, namely learning communicative skills focused on basic conversational skills.

As previously explained, this article focuses on the perspective of international student interns in teaching English at Thammislam Foundation School. Perspective is perception which means the ability to be aware of objects or phenomena using the five senses. Rakhmat (2013) explained that perception is the first step in receiving information, called sensation, through the senses. Humans have five senses to receive information from the environment. One acquires knowledge and all abilities to interact in real situations. According to Gibson in Rahmatullah (2014:11-13), Internal factors that influence perception, namely the factors contained within the individual, include several things, among others: A. Physiological Information enters through the senses, then the information obtained will affect and complement efforts to perceive each person differently so that the interpretation of the environment can also be different. B. Attention Individuals need a certain amount of energy expended to pay attention or focus on the physical form and mental facilities that exist in an object. Each person's energy is different, so one's attention to objects is also different, which will affect an object’s perception. C. Interest The perception of an object varies depending on how much energy or perceptual violence is driven to perceive it. Perceptual vigilance is a person's tendency to pay attention to a certain type of stimulus or can be said as interested. D. Unidirectional Needs This factor can be seen from how strong an individual is in looking for objects or messages that can provide answers according to him. E. Experience and Memory Experience can be said to depend on memory in the sense of how far one can remember past events to find out a stimulus in a broad sense. F. Mood Emotional state affects a person's behavior. This mood shows how a person feels at a time that can affect how a person receives, reacts, and remembers. For English, as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers to be effective in their classrooms, they need essential competencies. Richards (2013) defines ten core aspects of language teaching expertise and practice: language proficiency, content knowledge, teaching skills, and contextual knowledge. Language teacher identity, student-focused teaching, pedagogical reasoning skills, theorizing from practice, a community of practice membership, and professionalism.
2. RESEARCH METHOD
The approach used in this study is a qualitative approach which is presented in a descriptive presentation. Judging from the object and the results to be obtained, this research is included in the type of descriptive research using qualitative methods. Descriptive research is research conducted to determine the value of one or more variables without making comparisons and connecting with other variables. According to Moleong (2017: 6), qualitative research is research that intends to understand phenomena about what is experienced by research subjects, such as behavior, perceptions, motivations, actions, and others, holistically and by means of descriptions in the form of words and language, in a special natural context by utilizing various natural methods. Qualitative research, according to Hendryadi, et. al (2019: 218), is a process of naturalistic inquiry that seeks an in-depth understanding of natural social phenomena. Sugiyono (2017) also mentions that qualitative research concentrates on describing the meaning of induction data obtained from natural objects where the researcher acts as a research instrument. This approach was chosen because using processability theory as a reference in mastering foreign languages in Indonesia is still very rare. The following are the stages of this research: 1. Stage Description The researcher collected data regarding the description of the object of his research, namely the views of international apprentice students at Thammislam Foundation School when teaching English. 2. Reduction Stage

Researchers filter the information needed in this study as the primary research focus. At this stage, the intern students filled out a questionnaire as a medium to share their views on teaching English at the Thammislam Foundation School. 3. Selection Stage Researchers analyzed the data reduction in detail to obtain knowledge construction in this study. The results of data reduction coding are then analyzed in terms of structure English, and existing suitability. 4. Conclusion Stage Researchers conclude from the data analysis done in the previous stage. At this stage, the researcher concludes the results of the analysis without generalizing the results. 5. The Lighting Stage Researchers double-checked to ensure the credibility of the data used in this study. At this stage, the research assistants conducted interviews with participants with the same questions to find out the consistency of the answers given by the participants. The data collection technique used in this research is document study. Primary data were obtained from a study of 7 English education students conducting a student exchange program at Thammislam Foundation School. Data were analyzed using five qualitative data analysis steps: data collection, data reduction, data presentation, data verification, and conclusion (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014). The research data is then compared. Comparative data is presented in a table for easy reading. Data verification was carried out by conducting verification interviews with several participants. The conclusion of the data is then taken as material for analysis.

of a teacher their english. if I am accompanied by
Mrs. Nazwa they understand better what I convey
and their learning outcomes are also much better

The questionnaire provided is 6 questions, including: (1) What do you think about students’ abilities in carrying out the teaching and learning process in the classroom? (2) What is the behavior or attitude of Thammislam Foundation School's students in the internship program when interacting with University of Muhammadiyah North Sumatra students around the school? (3) How did you feel when you first arrived at Thammislam Foundation School? (4) What do you think after Thammislam Foundation School's students studied the material prepared by students of the University of Muhammadiyah North Sumatra? (5) What do you think about students' understanding and knowledge of learning English? (6) Do you think the response of school students in Indonesia is better than students in Thailand about learning English?
A. SECTION 1
based on the question "What do you think about the ability of students in carrying out the teaching and learning process in the classroom?" the author gets several answers that the author considers interesting to respond to, namely as follows:
- I think it's the same with Indonesian students. No special abilities were mentioned. They learn English the hard way, as easily, as easily as we have ever seen as students in general. If they are good at English then it is ok for them but if they are bad at English then it is a problem for them.
from the exposure of the first intern student's response said that there was no significant difference that distinguished Indonesian students from Thai students, it was just that the teaching techniques used by Thai teachers themselves might be different from teachers in Indonesia.
- My opinion about the ability of students in carrying out the teaching and learning process in class is that students in class are very active when I give creative material in class, they tend to want to be fully involved in the ongoing teaching and learning process.
From the presentation of the second intern student, it appears that the English teaching situation is quite cooperative and responsive, but not all of these situations exist in every class. Some students are interested in learning foreign languages, but not a few students are not interested in learning foreign languages.
B. SECTION 2
based on this question, "What is the behavior or attitude of the Thammislam School Foundation students in the internship program when interacting with North Sumatra Muhammadiyah University students around the school?" the author gets several answers which, according to the author, are interesting to respond to, namely as follows:


Indonesian Journal of Education & Mathematical Science Vol. 4, No. 3, September 2023, pp. 122~129 ISSN:2721-3838,DOI: 10.30596/ijems.v4i3.16071

- the students there really appreciate me as a teacher in their school, they always greet and smile when they see me around the school, and they also give me their food when they see me and other colleagues eating, they also give us snacks after class.
Based on the perception of first students, this is very interesting because this is a cultural custom that belongs to the Thai people, who really appreciate the guests who come. students are not racist towards people not from their country, so the learning process improves because they respect each other.
-This is amazing. They respect people.
Based on the perception second student, the same as the description above, if the teacher and teacher respect each other, the student learning system can run well, and the knowledge conveyed will be much easier to understand.
C. SECTION 3
Based on this question “How did you feel when you first arrived at the Thammislam Foundation School?” the author gets several answers which, according to the author, are interesting to respond to, namely as follows:
-I feel amazed. Not only the building and the facilities but the fact that technically I was a real foreign school with a different culture.
From the first apprentice students, the environment looks very different compared to Indonesia. For some reason, all of the apprentice students felt that the school facilities were exceptionally complete, and it seems that in Indonesia itself, these complete facilities are only owned by well-known schools. but unfortunately, with such good school facilities, it doesn't put too much pressure on learning English.
- I am very grateful because they treat us like their friends/family, and also the environment looks very clean.
from student apprentices, the environment looks clean, which is good because students need a good atmosphere for learning, it's just that the motivation to learn English needs to be instilled even more.
D. SECTION 4
Based on this question, "What do you think after the Thammislam Foundation School students studied the material prepared by Muhammadiyah University students of North Sumatra?" the author gets several answers which, according to the author are interesting to respond to, namely as follows:
- I feel the same. They are not very interested in our materials, I think they feel happy just because of our existence.
This is an essential note for international internship students because, abroad, there is no guarantee that the country will use English correctly. students are miserable when schools have good facilities to study more intensely, but with a lack of interest in learning English, some difficulties will be faced.
- They were a bit shocked for the first time.
This results in a different mother tongue which makes it difficult for students to communicate with international intern students. The limitation of not being too proficient in English and their own daily language, namely Tagalog, makes it difficult for students to convey their opinions.
E. SECTION 5
based on this question, "What do you think about students' understanding and knowledge of learning English?" the author gets several answers which according to the author are interesting to respond to, namely as follows:


Indonesian Journal of Education & Mathematical Science Vol. 4, No. 3, September 2023, pp. 122~129 ISSN:2721-3838,DOI: 10.30596/ijems.v4i3.16071

- In my opinion, the students' understanding of the learning that I provide is quite good. Still, because there are language limitations that occur during the teaching and learning process, it makes it difficult for some students to get good income as expected, but this happens when I teach alone without the help of a language teacher their English. if I am accompanied by Mrs.Nazwa they understand better what I convey and their learning outcomes are also much better.
just like in the previous session, they needed translators to help them understand the lesson, it seems like the initial Indonesian method can help students in Thailand to learn better with the help of English toTagalog translation.
-Some are then easy to understand but some are not
The second statement is not much different from the first statement, the constraints on the main language should be that the English students learn can be far more optimal if they have the same understanding of the language.
F. SECTION 6
based on this last question "Do you think the response of school students in Indonesia is better than students in Thailand about learning English?" the author gets several answers which according to the author are interesting to respond to, namely as follows:
- It depends, some students in Indonesia give a good response. Some don't. Likewise in Thai.
there is no excessive difference between the two countries in terms of English among students, not all of them are interested but both of them still want to learn English well.
- Full of curiosity.
Their curiosity makes international internship students consistently teach English enthusiastically even though they lack interest but greatly desire to learn.
4. CONCLUSION
The International Internship program has provided benefits for students who take it. Mastery of English is the focus of this research. In this study, it was found that participants from Thai and Indonesian schools had similar levels of mastery of English morphology. the reason is that English in Thailand is a language that is rarely used actively in several sectors such as commerce, business, government, and education. English is used by participants only when there is English material when interacting with foreigners and when there are international-scale activities.

Teacher performance, interpersonal communication, work motivation, SITOREM analysis
In educational institutions, teachers are a core part of the management element. Teacher Performance Assessment is an assessment of each item of the teacher's main task activities in the context of career development, rank, and position. This assessment is carried out through observation and monitoring. Observation is a process of collecting teacher performance data which is carried out through direct observation of how the teacher works when delivering learning material or guidance in class to students. Observations consist of before observations, during observations and after observations. The implementation of the main task of a teacher cannot be separated from the ability of a teacher in mastering knowledge, skills, and attitudes in carrying out their duties as professional educators. This is a manifestation of the required competencies as regulated in Permendiknas Number 16 of 2007 concerning Academic Qualification Standards and Teacher Competencies. In order to improve teacher performance, research is needed to obtain good information about other variables that can be used to improve teacher performance. The purpose of this study is to make efforts to improve teacher performance by conducting research on the influence between teamwork, interpersonal communication, adversity quotient and work motivation. This study uses the path analysis method (path analysis) to determine the effect between the variables studied and the SITOREM method for indicator analysis in order to obtain optimal solutions in an effort to improve teacher performance. The population of this study were 289 teachers of SMK PGRI in Bogor Regency. From the population, samples were taken using the Slovin formula and a sample of 168 people was obtained. The results of the analysis using the path analysis method show that there is a positive influence between teamwork and teacher performance with a large effect of βz1 = 0.418 so that strengthening teamwork can improve teacher performance. There is a positive influence between interpersonal communication and teacher performance with a large effect of βz2 = 0.398 so that the strengthening of interpersonal communication can improve teacher performance. There is a positive influence between adversity quotient and teacher performance with a large effect of βz3 = 0.445 so that strengthening adversity quotient can improve teacher performance. There is a positive influence between work motivation and teacher performance with a large effect of βz4 = 0.419 so that strengthening work motivation can improve teacher performance. From the SITOREM analysis, the optimal solution is obtained, namely from the 27 indicators studied there are 14 indicators that are in good condition so that these indicators only need to be maintained or developed, and there are 13 indicators that are still weak and need to be improved. Improvements to indicators that are still weak are complemented by a priority order for their handling. Good indicators are: 1) Ownership, 2) Resilience, 3) Achievement, 4) Job attachment, 5) Good supervision, 6) Adequate rewards, 7) Trust, 8) Harmony, 9) Completeness, 10) Empathy , 11) Openness, 12) Positivity, 13) Work Productivity and 14) Quantity of Work Results Indicators that need to be improved in order of priority for handling are as follows: 1st Control, 2nd Authenticity, 3rd Desire to get appreciation and recognition, 4th Job Guarantee, 5th Desire for power, 6th Accountability, 7th Group Goal Orientation, 8th Coordination, 9th Support, 10th Equality, 11th Quality of Work, 12th Work Effectiveness, 13th Work Efficiency.

1. INTRODUCTION
Human resources in educational organisations play a very important role. This is based on the belief that individuals are the formulators of organisational goals and at the same time the main drivers to achieve goals. Each individual in the organisation has an obligation to complete the main tasks in accordance with their responsibilities. As members of the organisation, individuals have an obligation to work together in realising organisational goals. Teacher Performance Appraisal is an assessment of each item of the teacher's main task activities in the context of career development, rank, and position. This assessment is conducted through observation and monitoring. Observation is a process of collecting teacher performance data through direct observation of how teachers work when delivering learning materials or mentoring in the classroom to students. Observation consists of before observation, during observation and after observation. The implementation of the teacher's main task cannot be separated from the ability of a teacher to master the knowledge, skills and attitudes in carrying out his duties as a professional educator. This is a manifestation of the required competencies as stipulated in Permendiknas No. 16/2007 concerning Standards for Academic Qualifications and Teacher Competencies. In order to improve teacher performance, research is needed to obtain good information about other variables that can be used to improve teacher performance. Based on a preliminary survey conducted through distributing questionnaires to 30 teachers at 7 SMK PGRI in Bogor Regency, it was found that there were 41.7% teachers who were not optimal in achieving the quality of work results. There were 36.7% teachers who were not optimal in work effectiveness, 35% teachers were not optimal in work efficiency, 40% teachers were not optimal in work productivity, and 35% teachers were not optimal in quantity of work results. The survey results above show that teacher performance still needs to be improved and given that teacher performance is an important element related to achieving educational goals. Therefore, teacher performance is interesting to study. The purpose of the study is to produce optimal solutions in improving teacher performance by finding the right strategies and ways to improve teacher performance, which is by strengthening the independent variables that have a positive effect on teacher performance. These variables are teamwork, interpersonal communication, adversity quotient and work motivation. The optimal solution found is then used as a recommendation to related parties, including teachers, principals, school supervisors, school organising agencies and education offices.
Literature Review A. Teacher Performance
Mathis, Robert L, et all (2011) [1], performance is a description of the level of achievement of the implementation of an activity/program/policy in realising the goals, objectives, mission and vision of the organisation as stated in the strategic planning of an organisation. The performance indicators are as follows: 1) Work quantity, meaning the volume of work produced under normal conditions, 2) Quality of work, which can be in the form of tidiness accuracy and relevance of results by not ignoring the volume of work, 3) Utilisation of time, which is the use of working time adjusted to the policies of the organisation or government agency, and 4) Cooperation, which is the ability to handle relationships with other people at work. Gary Dessler (2012) [2], performance is the actual achievement of employees compared to the expected performance of employees. Expected work achievement is the achievement of standards that are prepared as a reference on how to see the performance of employees in accordance with their position compared to the standards made. By indicators: 1) Quality. Work quality is measured by employee perceptions of the quality of work produced and the perfection of tasks on employee skills and abilities. 2) Quantity. It is the amount produced expressed in terms such as the number of units, the number of activity cycles completed. 3) Timeliness. It is the degree to which activities are completed at the beginning of the stated time, seen from the angle of coordination with output results and maximising the time available for other activities. 4) Effectiveness. It is the degree to which the use of organisational resources (manpower, money, technology, raw materials) is maximised with a view to increasing the output of each unit of resource use. 5) Independence represents the degree to which an employee will be able to perform his/her job functions Work commitment. It is the degree to which an employee has a work commitment with the agency and responsibility. Stephen P. Robbins and Mary Coulter (2012) [3], performance is the end result of an activity, with the criteria of whether these results can be considered efficient and effective with the criteria for measuring performance, including work productivity, work effectiveness, and efficiency shown by workers. Jason A. Colquitt, et. all (2016) [4], performance is a number of behaviours and contributions of organisational members to the achievement of organisational goals. Performance is reflected in the work results shown by employees. Performance has 3 dimensions, including: task performance, citizenshipbehaviour and counter-productive behaviour. Based on the theoretical study above, it can be synthesised that Teacher Performance is a person's achievement which is the result of work in carrying out the tasks assigned to him in accordance with organisational goals, which can be measured based on the following indicators: 1) Work Productivity, 2) Work Effectiveness, 3) Work Efficiency, 4) Quality of Work Results, and 5) Quantity of Work Results.

Stephen P. Robbins and Timothy A. Judge (2013) [5], teamwork or work team is a group whose members produce group performance that is greater than the sum of individual performances with the following indicators: performance as a collective, between group members synergise with each other, prioritising togetherness (not individuals), and between members complement each other's skills and expertise. J.L. Gibson, et.al (2016) [6], group work is a group of individuals whose behaviour and performance influence each other between one member and another. With the following indicators: The members have the same goal (Group Goals), Strong interpersonal relationships between members, The group fosters togetherness, and between members complement each other (proximity). R. Kreitner & A. Kinicki (2010) [7], group work pattern is a group of individuals who feel satisfied working in a group and each is willing to contribute to the group. Factors that influence group cooperation: group goals are clearly formulated, active participation of members, relationships between members are informal, decisions are taken together (consensus), open interpersonal communication, clear group norms, and complementary abilities. Tenner, A.R., & DeToro, I.J., (2012) [8], Teamwork is a group of people who work together to achieve the same goals and these goals will be easier to obtain by doing teamwork than doing it alone. With the following indicators: Evaluation and rewards, Social relationships, Organisational support, Task characteristics, and Leaders. DeJanaz, et.al (2006) [9], Teamwork is the ability of individuals to cooperate well in achieving the goals and objectives of the team and its members are able to participate in the team and get satisfaction in the team, with the characteristics of having goals, understanding roles and duties, trusting and supporting each other and being responsible for carrying out tasks to achieve common goals. With the following indicators: Having clear goals, Understanding tasks and roles in the team, Trusting and supporting each other, Being able to participate in the team, and Being responsible for the team. Based on the descriptions above, it can be synthesised that teamwork is a group of individuals to carry out good cooperation that is interconnected with each other and is easier to obtain by doing teamwork than doing it alone, which contains elements of trust, honesty, mutual trust, support, and responsibility in carrying out tasks to achieve common goals with indicators, including: 1) Coordination, 2) Coordination, and 3) Teamwork: 1) Coordination, 2) Accountability, 3) Harmony, 4) Trust, 5) Orientation to Group Goals. and 6) Completeness.
C. Interpersonal Communication
According to Stephen W. Littlejohn & Karen A foss (2018) [10], communication (in the interpersonal sense) is the verbal exchange of thoughts or ideas. There are several aspects that need to be considered by the actors in interpersonal communication for interpersonal communication to take place effectively. Aspects of interpersonal communication are openness, empathy, support, positivity and equality. According to John R. Schermerhorn, et. al. (2017) [11], communication is the interpersonal process of the sending and receiving of symbols with messages attached to them. There are four dimensions that have an impact on interpersonal communication: self-image, image of others, physical environment and social environment. According to Amitkumar Singh, (2014) [12], interpersonal communication is the process by which information and general understanding is transmitted between one person and another. Dimensions of interpersonal communication are openness, which is the willingness to respond willingly to information received in dealing with interpersonal relationships; empathy, which is feeling what others feel; supportiveness, which is an open situation to support effective communication; positivity, a person must have positive feelings about himself, encourage others to participate more actively, and create a communication situation conducive to effective interaction; and equality, which is a tacit recognition that both parties value, are useful, and have something important to contribute. According to Fred Luthans, (2016) [13], interpersonal communication is considered as a basic method to influence behaviour change. It combines psychological processes (perception, learning and motivation) on the one hand and language on the other hand. The indicator of interpersonal communication is intention. Effective feedback is designed to improve performance and the results of work become a more valuable asset, Specificity. Effective feedback is designed to provide specific information to the recipient so that they know what to do to improve Effective feedback can also be characterised as descriptive rather than evaluative, usefulness. Effective feedback is information that employees can use to improve their performance, Timeliness. There are also considerations about the timing of feedback. In general, the earlier the feedback, the better. That way, the employee has a better chance of knowing what the manager is talking about and can take corrective action, Readiness. For feedback to be effective, employees must be ready to receive it. If feedback is imposed or forced on the employee, it is much less effective, Clarity. Effective feedback needs to be clearly understood by the recipient. A good way of checking this is to ask the recipient to repeat the main points of the discussion and validity. For feedback to be effective, it must be reliable and valid. Of course, if the information is wrong, the employee will feel that the manager is unnecessarily biased, or the employee may take corrective action that is inappropriate and only addresses a minor problem. Based on the description of the concept above, it can be synthesised that interpersonal communication is an activity of sending and receiving messages reciprocally carried out by individuals who have a close relationship in order to achieve the desired goals in the organisation with indicators: 1). Openness (Opennes), 2) Equality (Equility), 3) Empathy (Emphaty), 4) Possitiveness and 5) Supportiveness.
D. Adversity Quotient
Adversity intelligence is the ability to turn obstacles into opportunities for success in order to achieve goals, according to Paul G. Stoltz (2005) [14]. The dimensions of adversity intelligence are called CO2RE, namely Control, how much control is felt over the difficulties or failures experienced. Origin and Ownership, related to the view of the origin of the adversity and the recognition of the consequences of the adversity experienced. Scope, related to the extent to which adversity is perceived to span life. Endurance, a view of how long the adversity and its causes will last.

Adversity Quotient, related to how well individuals are able to solve and combat the problems they face, according to Rachapoom Pangma, at.al (2009) [15]. The indicators of the adversity quotient are as follows Identification of problems and how to respond or not to respond to the problem, search and development of ego identity or self-control in problem situations, adaptation and adjustment to the environment, individual strength to face problems (physical and mental) and adjustment to stressful situations. According to Dr Andy Green (2006) [16], adversity intelligence is the desire to succeed in achieving a goal, the resilience to bounce back and the nature of not giving up easily in achieving goals. The indicators of adversity intelligence are as follows: Desire to succeed, Self-resilience, Not giving up easily and Ability to bounce back. Maxwell, J. C. (2004) [17], adversity intelligence is the ability to turn failure into a springboard. The indicators of adversity intelligence are as follows: Never giving up, Viewing failure as temporary, Viewing failure as an event in itself, Having realistic expectations, Focusing on strengths, Using multiple approaches, and Recovering easily. Based on various previous explanations, it can be summarised that the Adversity Quotient is an individual characteristic that is a response to various difficulties and obstacles in the performance of tasks. The indicators of adversity quotient are as follows: 1) control, 2) origin, ownership, reach and persistence.
E. Work Motivation
Jennifer M. George and R. Jones, (2012) [18], Work motivation is a psychological force that determines the direction of one's behaviour in an organisation, the level of one's effort and the level of one's persistence. The elements of work motivation are as follows 1) Direction of behaviour, which is what behaviour a person chooses to perform in an organisation, 2) Level of effort, which is how hard a person works to perform the chosen behaviour, and 3) Level of persistence, which is how hard a person continues to try to perform the chosen behaviour successfully in the face of obstacles, barriers. Pinder, C. C. (2008) [19], Work motivation is a set of energetic forces that come from both inside and outside the individual to initiate work-related behaviour and to determine the form of direction, intensity and duration. Motivation is generally based on three aspects, that is Direction, which is the goal to be achieved; Intensity, which is the level and strength; and Duration/persistence, which is the time requirement. John R. Schermerhorn, Jr. at.al (2007) [20], Motivation refers to the forces within a person that account for the level, direction and persistence of effort made at work. Herzberg's two-factor theory identifies context as a source of satisfaction and dissatisfaction: Motivating factors, as internal factors that are a source of job satisfaction and promote motivation, Hygiene factors, as external factors in the work context, are a source of job dissatisfaction. Greenberg J & Baron Robert. A, (2008) [21], Motivation is a process that encourages, directs, and sustains human behaviour towards the achievement of a goal. Motivation will cause stimulation, encouragement within to do something as much as possible, and be properly directed in achieving goals. Motivation factors are: Stimulation, which is something that can influence someone to do activities; Maintenance, which is an activity in maintaining and taking good care of something; The arousal element, which is to arouse something in oneself in doing activities/work; and Direction, which is to provide a definite direction in achieving the desired goal. Based on the various previous explanations, it can be summarised that work motivation is the degree of encouragement, desire and impulse that grows in a person, both from within and from outside himself, to do a job with high enthusiasm, using all the abilities and skills he has, aiming at maximum achievement. Indicators of work motivation are 1) job relatedness, 2) power needs, 3) esteem and recognition, 4) adequate rewards, 5) job security, and 6) good supervision.
2. METHODOLOGY
As explained above, this research aims to develop strategies and ways to improve teacher performance by exploring the strength of influence between teacher performance as the dependent variable and teamwork, interpersonal communication, adversity quotient and work motivation as the independent variables. The research method used was a survey method with a path analysis approach for the testing of statistical hypotheses and the SITOREM method for the analysis of indicators for the determination of the optimal solution for the improvement of teacher performance. The research constellation of the variables studied and their indicators is as follows

Figure 1. The Constellation of Relationships between Variables and Researched Indicators
The research was conducted on teachers in SMK PGRI in Bogor Regency. The population was 289 teachers, and the sample size was 168 teachers, calculated using the Slovin formula from Umar [22]. Data collection in this study used research instruments in the form of questionnaires distributed to teachers as research respondents. The research instrument items were derived from the research indicators being studied. The research instrument was first tested for validity and reliability [23] before being distributed to the respondents. The validity test was carried out using the Pearson Product Moment technique, while the reliability test was carried out using the Cronbach Alpha formula. Homogeneity test, normality test, linearity test, simple correlation analysis, coefficient of determination analysis, partial correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing were carried out after data collection. In addition, an indicator analysis was carried out using Hardhienata's SITOREM method [24] to determine the priority order for the improvement of indicators as a recommendation to related parties. This is the result of this study. SITOREM uses three criteria to determine the order of priority for dealing with indicators: (1) the strength of the relationship between variables obtained from hypothesis testing, (2) the order of priority for dealing with indicators obtained from expert judgement, and (3) the value of the indicators obtained from the calculation of the data used from the responses of the research participants.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
A. The Effect of Teamwork towards the Teacher Performance
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a positive influence between teamwork and teacher performance, with a large effect of βz1 = 0.418. This means that the higher the teamwork, the higher the teacher performance. This means that teamwork needs to be strengthened if teacher performance is to be improved.

B. The Effect of Communication Interpersonal towards the Teacher Performance
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a positive influence between interpersonal communication and teacher performance, with a large effect of βz2 = 0.398. This means that the higher the interpersonal communication, the higher the teacher performance. The implication is that if teacher performance is to be improved, interpersonal communication needs to be strengthened. An empirical evaluation of the priority given to the indicators of interpersonal communication variables, taking into account the factors of cost, benefit, urgency and immediacy, shows that the indicators that are in a good state, so that they need to be maintained or developed, which are 1) Empathy (22%) (4.15), 2) Openness (20%) (4.28), and 3) Possitiveness (19%) (4.22) and the priority order of indicators that need to be improved are: Supportiveness (21%)(3.88) and Equality (18%) (3.77).

C. The Effect of Adversity Quotient towards the Teacher Performance
The results of data processing through statistical hypothesis testing show that there is a positive influence between interpersonal communication and teacher performance, with a large effect of βz3 = 0.445. This means that the higher the interpersonal communication, the higher the teacher performance. The implication is that in order to improve teacher performance, it is necessary to strengthen interpersonal communication. The empirical evaluation in relation to the priority of the indicators of interpersonal communication variables, taking into account the factors of cost, benefit, urgency and urgency, results in indicators that are in good condition so that they are maintained or developed, which are 1) Ownership (22%) (4.34), 2) Endurance (20%) (4.44), and 3) Reach (17%) (4.06), and the priority order of indicators that need to be improved is: 1) Control (23%) (3.77) and 2) Origin (18%) (3.98).

4. CONCLUSION
The following conclusions can be drawn from the discussion that has been described above: 1. There is a positive influence between teamwork and teacher performance with a large influence of 0.418. Therefore, strengthening teamwork can improve teacher performance. 2. Strengthening interpersonal communication can improve teacher performance. There is a positive influence between interpersonal communication and teacher performance with a magnitude of 0.318. 3. There is a positive influence between adversity quotient on teacher performance with a magnitude of 0.445 so that strengthening adversity quotient can improve teacher performance. 4. Strengthening work motivation can improve teacher performance.There is a positive influence between work motivation and teacher performance with a magnitude of 0.419. The above conclusions imply that if teacher performance is to be improved, it is necessary to strengthen teamwork, interpersonal communication, adversity quotient and work motivation.

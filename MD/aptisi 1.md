Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) has been widely recognized for its
positive impact on teaching practices, yet its foundational concepts and rela-
tionship with students cultural backgrounds, diversity, and specific implemen-
tation in science education to foster technopreneurship remain underexplored.
This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying and constructing
the concept of CRT and its integration with technopreneurship in science edu-
cation using the PRISMA systematic literature review method. Data were col-
lected from reputable international and national journal articles published be-
tween 2018 and 2023. The findings reveal that CRT in science education serves
as a framework for teaching that integrates students knowledge, experiences,
cultural backgrounds, and environments with scientific methods while respect-
ing individual diversity. Effective implementation requires teachers commitment
and skills to create inclusive learning environments tailored to diverse student
characteristics. Importantly, CRT inspires students to design technological in-
novations that address cultural challenges, thereby fostering entrepreneurial in-
terest and capabilities. This study contributes novel insights into how CRT in
science education bridges cultural understanding and technopreneurship devel-
opment, offering a transformative approach to science teaching that aligns with
global and local educational needs.

1. INTRODUCTION
The dynamics of 21st-century development and advancements in science and technology significantly
impact the competencies required of the younger generation [1–5]. Education goal has expanded beyond
achieving scientific competence, it now aims to produce individuals capable of becoming agents of change
who possess character and cultural awareness, ready to face future challenges [6–9].
This necessitates a transformation in education, prioritizing both cognitive skills and the development
of values and lifelong learning attitudes [10]. A significant challenge in modern education lies in addressing the

diversity of student backgrounds, which encompasses various cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic dimen-
sions [11–14]. Differences in these aspects often correlate with disparities in student achievement, particularly
among minority, immigrant, or economically disadvantaged groups [15, 16]. Teachers must understand and
adapt to this diversity by designing learning experiences that are inclusive and culturally relevant, enabling all
students to participate fully in the learning process [17, 18].
Transformative learning practices require integrating complex, real-world issues that resonate with
student experiences and cultural contexts, fostering emotional and intellectual engagement [19]. For instance,
involving families in discussions on cultural and societal issues can strengthen relationships and bridge gaps
between home and school [20]. This approach aligns with the principles of CRT, which emphasizes the im-
portance of teacher competencies in creating inclusive classrooms that respect and leverage student cultural
identities [12, 21].
CRT has shown a positive impact on learning outcomes and character building [22–24]. It highlights
the role of students as active participants in co-constructing knowledge, emphasizing the interplay between indi-
vidual experiences and broader societal narratives [25]. Despite its potential, research on CRT remains limited,
particularly in its application within science education. Most studies focus on enhancing teacher understand-
ing of CRT but do not thoroughly explore its broader conceptualization or its integration with contemporary
educational priorities like technopreneurship [26].
Technopreneurship, the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship, plays a critical role in ad-
dressing global challenges such as climate change and economic disparities. It equips students, particularly
those from marginalized backgrounds, with innovative and entrepreneurial skills essential for thriving in a
technology-driven economy [27, 28]. Integrating CRT into science education with a focus on technopreneur-
ship offers a novel approach to fostering inclusivity and preparing students for future challenges. Therefore,
this study aims to:
• Analyze CRT research trends.
• Develop a comprehensive concept of CRT within the context of science education and examine the
implementation of CRT in science education.
• Explore the connection between CRT and technopreneurship.
This research is significant for teachers and researchers as it provides insights into developing CRT-
based models and implementing them in science education to achieve sustainable development goals. By
addressing the intersection of culture, education, and technology, this study contributes to creating equitable
and inclusive learning environments while fostering innovation and global citizenship [29–31].
2. METHODOLOGY
The research method uses a qualitative approach in the form of a literature study, namely a System-
atic Literature Review (SLR) using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) technique [32, 33]. Systematic literature review is a way of identifying, evaluating and interpreting
research sources that are in accordance with the formulation of the problem or research topic area to be reviewed
using literature studies. The characteristics of SLR are very suitable for achieving research objectives.
SLR stages are divided into three, namely Planning, Conducting and Reporting. At the Planning stage,
planning and identification are carried out starting with transforming a problem into a research question. Based
on these research questions, researchers conducted the second stage, namely Conducting.The implementation
stage is divided into several sub-stages, namely identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. In the
identification stage, the process of searching for literature sources using the keywords ”Culturally Responsive
Teaching” OR ”CRT” AND ”Science” AND ”Education” with English and Indonesian versions through the
search media from Scopus and Google Scholar indexing media. The limitation of the journal publication
year, set between 2018 and 2023, ensured a focus on recent and relevant research within the scope of CRT
in Science Education. An initial search across multiple platforms yielded a total of 837 articles, with 697
sourced from Google Scholar and 140 from Scopus. This comprehensive approach highlights the breadth of
available literature while emphasizing the importance of using multiple databases to capture a diverse range of
studies. The combined dataset provided a robust foundation for further screening and analysis, enabling the
identification of high-quality articles that align with the research objectives.

Figure 1. SLR Research Stages
Furthermore, the screening stage is carried out starting from the title, keyword review and abstract
according to the parameters determined by the researcher. The article titles and content were reviewed to
ensure all exclusion requirements were met and relevant to this study [34]. Screening parameters are articles
in the range of 2018-2023, articles containing CRT keywords and articles on educational studies. At this stage,
137 articles were categorized and 689 were discarded.
Next step is eligibility, at the Eligibility stage, researchers conducted inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the entire contents of journal articles. The studies were analysed on the basis of full-text screening if they
met selection criteria [35, 36]. Articles selected were those that outlined the definition of CRT, the implemen-
tation of CRT and focused on the scope of science. Based on this stage, there were 16 articles that met the
eligibility criteria.
The next stage of the research process involved a detailed review and analysis of the 16 selected
articles using bibliometric analysis. This analysis aimed to uncover emerging trends and gaps in Critical Race
Theory (CRT) research within the scope of science education. By employing VOSviewer, a tool designed
for mapping and visualizing scientific literature, the analysis provided insights into the topics that have been
thoroughly explored and those that remain under-researched. These findings offered valuable opportunities for
identifying new areas for further study, particularly in expanding the application of CRT in science education
contexts.

This systematic approach not only ensured the validity and reliability of the findings but also provided
a robust framework for replicability in future studies. By combining bibliometric analysis with narrative synthe-

390 ❒ E-ISSN: 2656-8888 |P-ISSN: 2655-8807
sis, the research effectively bridged quantitative insights and qualitative interpretations. This integration offered
a comprehensive perspective on CRT research trends within the field of science education, highlighting both
well-explored areas and gaps that warrant further investigation. The narrative synthesis allowed for an in-depth
and balanced explanation of the findings, ensuring that the research questions were addressed thoroughly.
The application of PRISMA techniques further enhanced the methodological rigor by providing a
transparent and structured depiction of the article selection process and the criteria used. This clarity not only
reinforced the credibility of the study but also paved the way for future researchers to build upon its findings.
Figures 1 and Figure 2 play a crucial role in visually representing the stages of the SLR and the PRISMA
techniques, emphasizing the studys dedication to transparency and methodological precision. Together, these
efforts contribute significantly to the academic discourse, offering a solid foundation for innovative approaches
and deeper exploration in CRT-related research.
The PRISMA flowchart in Figure 2 outlines the systematic process used for article selection. Initially,
697 records were identified from Scopus and 140 from Google Scholar, totaling 837. After screening, 77
records from Scopus and 60 from Google Scholar met the criteria, resulting in 137 eligible records. Following
further filtering based on parameter sets and eligibility reviews, 689 studies were excluded. Four duplicate
records were removed, leaving 16 studies focusing specifically on the science scope for inclusion in the review.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
3.1. CRT Research Trends
Research trends in CRT from 2018 to 2023 were systematically analyzed using bibliometric tech-
niques, with VOSviewer playing a crucial role in visualizing and interpreting the patterns and relationships
within the field. The data collection process involved a comprehensive and methodical search across two
prominent academic databases, Scopus and Google Scholar, which are widely regarded for their extensive
repositories of scholarly work. This dual-database approach ensured that the review captured a broad spectrum
of relevant literature, minimizing the risk of overlooking significant studies. From these searches, a total of 16
articles were identified as being highly relevant to CRT research, particularly in the context of Science Educa-
tion. These articles were carefully reviewed to extract meaningful insights, trends, and contributions that have
shaped the understanding of CRT within this domain.
The 16 selected articles underwent a meticulous evaluation process to identify key themes and high-
light the research gaps that remain in the field. This process enabled the researchers to map out both the
progress and limitations of CRT scholarship in Science Education over the specified period. To ensure clar-
ity and accessibility, the identities and details of these articles were organized and summarized in Table ??,
which provides a detailed account of the studies reviewed. This table serves as a foundational reference for
understanding the scope and focus of CRT research, offering readers an organized view of the literature while
emphasizing its evolving impact on Science Education scholarship. By presenting the findings in a structured
manner, this analysis not only highlights the significant contributions made by the selected studies but also
points to opportunities for future research to further expand the boundaries of CRT in Science Education.

Based on the analysis of the 16 selected articles, it was found that the research studies that have been
conducted are grouped into three parts, namely the knowledge, understanding and skills of teachers towards
CRT, opinions and perceptions of learners towards CRT and implementation of CRT in learning. Studies related
to teachers knowledge and understanding of CRT are needed to reveal the limits of teachers abilities based
on their knowledge findings. [37] found teachers beliefs and attitudes improved after they understood CRT.
Teachers considered that CRT holds great promise for engaging underserved learners such as rural learners
[38]. Students cannot remove their habits and ways of life and bring them to the classroom so CRT is needed
to facilitate learners with their own characteristics. Proper knowledge of CRT can motivate teachers to change
their teaching practices in the classroom. The teaching and learning process carried out by teachers should
condition the classroom according to the culture brought uniquely by students.
Teachers are very enthusiastic about this training so that it has a positive impact on the attitudes,
knowledge and attitudes of teachers so that it motivates them to change classroom teaching practices. Through

training or educational programs, teachers improve teaching skills that focus on building diverse student life
experiences. Teachers also have access to the educational reality and more able to experience the problems
occulting in practice of the education [39, 40].
The learning model most used by teachers is cross cultural communication [41]. So, that teachers must
have confidence and cultivate cultural responsiveness in teaching diverse students. Teachers need to develop
an understanding of cultural implications and minimize tensions that may arise due to each student differences.
This aims to increase learners success in learning. By considering the character and culture of students, teachers
can manage the classroom optimally.
More specifically, the study of CRT understanding and knowledge from teachers in science classes
was researched [42]. This study summarizes the stories of teachers who cross cultural boundaries in imple-
menting CRT in the classroom and teachers find that storytelling is one of the tools that can describe culture
and build students thinking skills in linking fairy tales with the real world in science material. It is necessary to
conduct research to identify and reconstruct local community science, which will be integrated into the science
learning curriculum [43].
CRT knowledge has also been examined from learners perspectives. Students argue that in order for
teachers to teach effectively to students who have diverse backgrounds, teachers need an understanding of the
local culture of students and the impact of the culture brought by these students so that teachers can develop in-
structional designs to implement CRT type teaching [36]. Diverse perceptions of students character and cultural
diversity and valuable opportunities to learn from and appreciate differences through discussion and collabora-
tion between students. Students stated that it is important to understand and appreciate each other differences in
order to learn together and share problems that may occur during learning so that it creates motivation and pas-
sion in learning. Proximity and good communication between students will minimize the problem of student
gaps [34]. This can certainly reduce the chances of bullying practices in the school environment
3.2. CRT Concepts and Implementation in Science Education
Previous research defines CRT as limited to culture alone but this is wrong [24], because CRT not only
considers culture but also other aspects such as background, language, characteristics, life habits, perspectives
and cultural experiences of students in all aspects of learning [25, 44]. CRT research in science education
defines CRT in several ways. The ideological foundation of CRT is caring that begins with personal and
professional self-awareness. CRT has generally been defined in accordance with the concept proposed by
the first originator of CRT, CRT as a teaching concept that uses cultural knowledge, backgrounds, previous
experiences, life habits, performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning more relevant and
effective for them. This proves that CRT considers the diversity of student characters and backgrounds and
respects the culture that students bring to learning so that students get equal rights in learning [35, 43].
Science education is seen as an important aspect of contemporary culture because science can have
an influence on the development of other sciences [45]. Science itself is the study of nature and the processes
that occur in nature through a series of scientific processes. The concept of CRT in science education can be
explained as a form of teaching that explores and constructs scientific knowledge from the basic knowledge,
experience, culture and environment of students through scientific methods without ignoring the characteristics
and background of students. Teaching is carried out according to the characteristics, abilities and learning
needs of students so that there is justice in learning [16, 24, 25].
Science materials are taught through the exploration of basic knowledge and culture that students have
or that is in the students environment. This is an effort to facilitate students in contextualized and humanized
learning so that it is believed to increase knowledge, train skills and build student character. More specifically,
CRT can improve academic achievement, develop cultural competence, train higher-order thinking skills, instill
self-awareness of cultural competence in multicultural classrooms, build emotional and social development
from cultural awareness and build students concern and involvement in relationships with others [42, 46, 47].
Science concepts can be linked to culture [48]. It is intended that by integrating students culture and
background into science learning, students can recognize culture from the science side and science material
can also be understood through examples raised from culture or student experiences. A lot of science content
and context can be extracted from cultural sources and students environment so that students can reason more
and trigger their thinking skills. By studying local culture and linking it with science materials, students are
required to analyze, evaluate, and create various phenomena that occur with the concepts they learn in science
learning. In addition, science materials that are integrated with culture can strengthen moral values and local

culture and become a filter for negative influences from the globalization era [49–51].
CRT aligns with inquiry-based practices that engage students cultural backgrounds, enhancing their
understanding of scientific concepts, discuss how inquiry-based practices can be integrated with students funds
of knowledge through activities such as analyzing local environmental issues. This connection not only en-
riches their learning experience but also fosters a sense of relevance and applicability of STEM in their lives,
potentially igniting interest in technopreneurship as students identify local problems that can be innovatively
addressed. [52] emphasizes the complementarity of CRT and inquiry-based science education, advocating
for equitable teaching practices that resonate with diverse learners. The research highlights that when teach-
ers connect scientific concepts to students cultural contexts, they can empower students to see themselves as
contributors to scientific discourse, thus promoting engagement in STEM fields and nurturing future techno-
preneurs. Additionally, the development of culturally responsive science and mathematics teaching models is
crucial in creating inclusive learning environments. [53] illustrate how integrating students cultural artifacts
and narratives into the curriculum can facilitate a more relatable learning experience, ultimately enhancing
students engagement and problem-solving skills in technology-related fields.
Teacher preparedness is a critical factor in the successful implementation of CRT in science education.
[54] argue that teacher education programs must better prepare candidates for culturally responsive instruction,
particularly by enhancing their understanding of diversity and Otherness. Professional development activities
that focus on CRT can significantly improve teachers ability to design lessons that are both culturally relevant
and scientifically rigorous. [55] present a conceptual framework for integrated STEM education that under-
scores the necessity for professional development aimed at building teachers CRT self-efficacy. This frame-
work not only improves instructional practices but also supports the nurturing of diverse student populations
who are equipped for technopreneurship.
Schools that effectively implement culturally responsive practices can serve as valuable case studies
for demonstrating the impact of CRT on student outcomes. For instance, [56] conducted a systematic review of
instructional practices in secondary education that highlighted several exemplary schools where CRT has led
to increased student engagement and performance in STEM subjects. These schools exemplify how culturally
responsive practices can transform science education, making it more inclusive and engaging for all students.
Moreover, the integration of Computational Thinking (CT) in STEM education, enriched by CRT, prepares
students for future innovation. [57] discuss how robotics and game design contexts can be enhanced by incor-
porating cultural narratives, fostering a deeper connection to the material that can inspire students to pursue
technopreneurship. Based on the research results, it was found that many CRT studies are limited because the
application of students own culture and background in the classroom is contextual and the process must be
situational so that it is difficult to be widely applied when dealing with ethnically diverse students [56, 58].
3.3. Linkage of CRT Concept to the Scope of Technopreneurship
In science learning, students are often faced with abstract science material so it is necessary to apply a
learning model that can present science material actually to students [59]. One of the things that can be done is
by linking science material with local culture and wisdom around students. Culture and local wisdom can be a
source of learning that is close to students. One of the learning concepts that considers cultural background to
be raised in learning is CRT. CRT can be combined with a project-based learning model that raises real-world
problems to be solved through project activities [60]. Many real-world problems related to culture can be raised
in learning so as to train students to solve problems [61]. Problems related to this culture can be sought for
creative solutions that have the opportunity to become a form of creative product. Furthermore, these creative
products can be sold and become a source of income for students [62].
Many problems are related to culture and local wisdom; for example, the traditional cooking process
of food often causes problems such as cooking results that do not meet the characteristics and original flavors so
that traditional food cannot be marketed optimally. One example of a problem in the traditional food cooking
process is the cooking of putu bamboo cake. If cooked in large quantities and larger sizes, the center of putu
bamboo cannot be cooked perfectly [63]. This problem can be a project topic in science learning that is solved
by applying the CRT concept. Science learning with the CRT concept is expected to improve mastery of science
concepts and awaken students thinking skills [64].
The CRT concept in science education can encourage students to develop technological innovations
that are relevant to the scope of technopreneurship. The CRT concept teaches students to be able to accept the
differences that exist so that students are open-minded in facing problems in their lives [65]. Culture-related

394 ❒ E-ISSN: 2656-8888 |P-ISSN: 2655-8807
problems, such as bamboo putu cooking problems, can be solved with project activities [62, 65]. Students
can design innovative cooking tools to cook putu bamboo in large quantities and larger sizes so that it has
the potential to open a business world for students. Student innovation products still strive for putu bamboo
according to their characteristics. It is because the CRT concept makes students still try to maintain their
cultural identity despite the development of increasingly sophisticated technology [66, 67].
The foundation of CRT lies in its ability to engage students by making learning relevant to their
cultural contexts. [68] emphasize the importance of adapting educational practices to the cultural backgrounds
of students, which can lead to improved engagement in technology-related fields. This adaptability fosters a
learning environment where students feel valued and understood, thus enhancing their motivation to participate
in technological projects [68]. Moreover, research by [69] indicates that leveraging social media tools, such
as Facebook and blogs, can enhance student engagement by allowing students to discuss culturally relevant
topics. This integration of technology not only reinforces CRT principles but also provides a platform for
collaborative learning. For instance, using Facebook groups to facilitate discussions around science projects
can help students share their diverse perspectives, thereby driving technological innovation through shared
cultural insights [69].
Research suggests that implementing CRT in the classroom can lead to innovative educational out-
comes. [70] document the positive impact of the Culturally Responsive Instruction Observation Protocol
(CRIOP) on student achievement. Their findings suggest that when teachers incorporate students cultural
backgrounds into science projects, students not only engage more deeply but also develop innovative solutions
that reflect their heritage. For example, a project where students design experiments based on their cultural
practices can foster both innovation and critical thinking skills. Additionally, [71] illustrate how integrating
CRT into computational thinking curricula can enhance teacher self-efficacy and student engagement. Their
pilot studies show that teachers trained in CRT principles successfully implemented culturally relevant projects,
such as robotics programs that resonate with students cultural interests. This approach not only promotes tech-
nological innovation but also encourages students to perceive themselves as capable contributors to the field.
Another significant initiative involves the use of culturally relevant examples in STEM lessons, where teachers
trained in Culturally Responsive Instruction (CRI) techniques reported significant improvements in student en-
gagement and performance [72]. Such pilot studies underscore the effectiveness of CRT in creating inclusive
learning environments that drive technological innovation.
[73] suggest that engagement analytics could be designed to reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds of
students, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of educational technologies in promoting engagement. Further
research could investigate how such analytics can be tailored to support CRT principles, thereby fostering in-
clusivity in technology-enhanced learning environments. Based on this, the concept of CRT plays an important
role in the scope of technopreneurship so that future research recommendations can be made for the develop-
ment of CRT-based learning models that can improve students mastery of science concepts through problems
in a cultural context as well as building students entrepreneurial skills in the scope of technopreneurship.
4. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATION
The integration of CRT in science education offers a strategic pathway to address diverse student needs
while simultaneously fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Managers and policymakers in educational
institutions should prioritize professional development programs that equip teachers with CRT competencies,
enabling them to create inclusive and culturally relevant learning environments. By aligning educational prac-
tices with students cultural contexts, institutions can improve engagement and academic performance, partic-
ularly in underserved communities. Moreover, linking CRT with technopreneurship prepares students for the
demands of a technology-driven economy, nurturing skills for innovation and problem-solving. Educational
leaders should also invest in curriculum designs that incorporate local cultural contexts into STEM education,
emphasizing project-based learning to address real-world challenges. This approach not only enhances stu-
dents mastery of scientific concepts but also builds entrepreneurial capabilities, fostering a new generation of
technopreneurs. Such strategic initiatives can position educational institutions as leaders in producing globally
competent and culturally aware graduates.

5. CONCLUSION
Based on bibliometric analysis, there are still gaps between variables that have not been connected
such as research on teacher storytelling has not directly involved other variables such as college teaching. Then
research on teacher professional learning has not directly involved other variables such as preservice teaching.
The results of research on the concept of CRT in science education found that there is a relationship between
CRT and science materials. Students can more easily understand the concept of science materials through CRT.
CRT in science education is a form of teaching that explores and constructs scientific knowledge from students
basic knowledge, experience, culture, and environment through scientific methods without ignoring students
characteristics and backgrounds. The implementation of CRT in the classroom requires a strong commitment,
skills, teacher attitudes and knowledge in creating learning that can accommodate students learning needs based
on students diverse characteristics, backgrounds, and cultures. The concept of CRT in science education can
encourage students to develop technological innovations that are relevant to the scope of technopreneurship.
To address the identified gaps, future research should focus on exploring how CRT principles can be
systematically integrated into teacher professional learning programs and preservice teaching curricula. For
instance, studies could investigate how storytelling techniques aligned with CRT principles can be applied in
higher education contexts to enhance teaching effectiveness. Furthermore, research should examine the de-
velopment and implementation of CRT-based teaching models specifically tailored for science education to
bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and classroom practices. Another area for future exploration
is the role of the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Education goal has expanded be-
yond achieving scientific competence; it now aims to produce. Such tools could provide valuable insights into
how CRT principles can be operationalized in technology-enhanced learning environments. Additionally, pilot
studies focusing on CRT-driven projects in STEM education, such as culturally relevant robotics or computa-
tional thinking curricula, could offer practical guidelines for educators and highlight the scalability of CRT in
fostering innovation and technopreneurship.
While this study provides a robust bibliometric analysis, it is important to acknowledge its limitations.
The analysis relies heavily on existing literature and lacks qualitative insights such as interviews or teacher sur-
veys that could deepen the understanding of the relationship between CRT and technopreneurship. Future
research could incorporate such qualitative approaches to complement the bibliometric findings and provide
a more holistic perspective on how CRT can be practically implemented to drive technological innovation in
classrooms. By addressing these limitations, future studies can better bridge the gap between theoretical in-
sights and practical applications. By prioritizing these research directions, scholars can contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of how CRT can be effectively implemented in diverse educational contexts,
ultimately enriching science education and empowering students to engage in meaningful technological inno-
vation.

However, all sources said that these three components had a great influence on the application of Muhammadiyah values in everyday life. Of the several factors inhibiting the application of Muhammadiyah values above, it is very important to maintain steadfastness in doing good. Avoid laziness, negligence and increase self-discipline. Association has a very large role in implementing Muhammadiyah values, so it is very important to choose associations that always remind us of the hereafter.

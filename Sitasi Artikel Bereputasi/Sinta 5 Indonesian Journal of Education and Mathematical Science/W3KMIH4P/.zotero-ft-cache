Edutainment method, learning outcome
Edutainment is a learning model that is designed to blend entertainment and educational content in harmony so that the activities that occur in the classroom are fun. This study aims to determine the effect of implementing the edutainment method in learning Islamic education on student learning outcomes at SMP Muhammadiyah 04 Medan. The research method used was a quasi-experimental method (pseudo). The population used in this study was class VIII students, totalling 80 people. The sample in this study were students of class VIII-A, totalling 33 students as the experimental class and students of class VIII-B as the control class. To obtain data on the implementation of the edutainment method, the researcher used a questionnaire technique, while to get data related to student learning outcomes in Islamic education subjects, they used a questionnaire and pretest/posttest. Meanwhile, to obtain other supporting data used interview techniques and documentation. Based on the results of the research data analysis using the t-test with a significance level of 5%, a value of 5% was obtained. If t count > t table then h0 is rejected and Ha is accepted, which was 3.879 > 2.04. It means that there is a difference in learning outcomes between using the edutainment method and the conventional method so it can be concluded that the edutainment method influences student learning outcomes in class VIII PAI learning at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan.

1. INTRODUCTION
In essence, humans who live in the world need education. Education is a conscious effort, which has the same subject, such as humans. A student who is a teenager needs a lot of knowledge about religious norms because students at a young age have a great urge and desire for something they are interested in. Meanwhile, according to the law on the national education system, education is a conscious and planned effort to create an atmosphere and learning process so that students actively develop their potential to have spiritual strength, religion, self-control, personality, and noble character needed by themselves and society. Learning outcomes are a number of experiences gained by students covering the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. The learning outcomes are real results achieved by students in an effort to master physical and spiritual skills at school (Sinta & Chemo-edutainment, 2020). Learning outcomes are also the realization of achieving educational goals so learning outcomes that are measured depend heavily on educational goals. Learning outcomes can be seen from changes in behaviour. However, not all changes in behaviour are called learning outcomes (Lestari et al., 2020). Learning outcomes are a very important ability in learning and education because those are related to achievement in obtaining abilities according to the specific goals planned. Thus, the main task of the teacher in this activity is to design an instrument that can collect data about students' success in achieving learning goals (Saripudin & Faujiah, 2018). Based on these data teachers can develop and improve learning programs. The learning process is a unique and complex process. This speciality is because learning outcomes only occur in individuals who learn, not in other people and each individual displays different learning behaviour. Learning outcomes that should occur in schools are learning outcomes that are able to achieve certain expectations and goals that have been set by students or teachers as a driving force for successful learning in education. In the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, educators are required not only to do learning-- just to transfer knowledge but more than that. In addition to knowledge competence, educators are required to create a learning atmosphere that is able to develop student and psychomotor competencies. That is, teachers are asked not only to make students knowledgeable but also to become students with morals and skills themselves to face the development of the industrial revolution 4.0 in the upcoming 21st century. 21st-century learning is characterized by an increase in the complexity of learning technology and the emergence of a corporate restructuring movement that emphasizes the combination of technological and human qualities. This tendency was responded to by education in Indonesia. One of the efforts made is to apply four educational approaches, such as: 1. Life skills education 2. competency-based learning, 3. product-based learning 4. Broad-based learning These approaches demand a rich and real learning environment and provide an integrative learning experience of competency dimensions. However, the implementation of learning activities in class is not as easy as the theory obtained. The application of learning activities or learning processes in the classroom often encounters obstacles or obstacles. This is because teaching is an integrated and complex system consisting of a number of components because, in learning activities, the teacher does not just provide information orally to students. For this reason, learning activities need to be designed, managed, implemented and evaluated in order to achieve the expected learning outcomes. To overcome this problem, the government 2019 issued a new policy. A speech by the Minister of Education, Nadhiem Makarim, introduced independent learning and transformational teachers. Through the transformational teacher policy, the Ministry of Education and Culture invites all teachers to make even the slightest changes in the classroom. These changes are made by: 1. Inviting the class to discuss, not just listening 2. Providing opportunities for students to teach 3. Creating a social project to involve all students 4. Finding talent in students 5. Offering assistance to teachers who have difficulty teaching For this reason, teachers need to make changes in the classroom, innovate, work together with fellow teachers and various related parties, and communicate well in order to create a competency-based learning atmosphere, life skills and innovative learning. The results of student learning outcomes can be caused by several factors. One of the factors is interest in participating in class learning depends on the teacher's strategy in creating, maintaining and developing students' interest in participating in learning. These factors affect every learning in formal education in educational institutions. Students in class VIII at SMP Muhammadiyah 04 Medan, especially in Islamic Education subjects, there were still many students who got scores below standard and there were still many students who did not understand the material that has been presented. This is caused by several factors, for example, the method still used the conventional method, such as the lecture method. The lecture method is not wrong to apply, in fact, a method like this is a tool to initiate learning for students, but this method cannot be used throughout the learning process, because the nature of learning itself is a process consisting of

combinations of learning that focus on what must be students do. This combination has the aim of changing attitudes both conceptually and operationally, so that with the lecture method almost students feel bored, even though they have been given media in the form of pictures. It is crucial to create certain conditions in learning so that students are always motivated, interested, and always want to learn. Learning as a process can be said to be a person's activity that is carried out intentionally through adjustments to his own behaviour in an effort to improve the quality of their life. If you see from the explanation above, the media and strategies in learning are essential to help students achieve maximum learning outcomes. For this reason, researchers implement the Edutainment program to improve student learning outcomes in learning Islamic education Edutainment is a learning that is designed in such a way as to combine education and entertainment content harmoniously so that learning is more fun. Fun learning is usually done with humour or games, role-playing and demonstrations. The concept of educative learning is very interesting to be developed systematically and measurably. If it runs smoothly, obviously, the learning atmosphere in the classroom will change, from something scary to something fun, from boring to very happy or something that is hated becomes something students miss so they want to continue learning in class because it is filled with enthusiasm for learning. The use of the edutainment method in learning can improve student learning outcomes and students are also seen to be active in carrying out activities so that the learning process becomes more enjoyable and does not make students feel bored and unenthusiastic.

Translation: And let fear (of Allah) those who, if they leave weak offspring behind them, fear for their (welfare). Therefore, let them fear Allah, and let them speak the right words. Basically, a teacher is a person who imparts knowledge to his students. Therefore the teacher should provide the best learning by using the best method so that learning material can be delivered to students and educational goals are carried out. The researcher felt the need to investigate this because the researcher observed that there were still many students who got scores below the average due to the poor student learning outcomes in Islamic Education learning influenced by a lack of learning methods. Therefore, based on the explanation above, the researcher measured whether there was an influence of the implementation of the Edutainment Method in Islamic Education Learning on Student Learning Outcomes at SMP Muhammadiyah 04 Medan.
2. METHODOLOGY
The method used in this study was a Quasi-experimental method (Pseudo). The quasi-experimental method is a method to find out whether there is an effect of something imposed on the research subject. In other words, the researcher attempted to find whether there was a causal relationship. This was done by comparing one or more comparison groups that did not receive treatment (Ahmad Rijai, 2018). The reason for using the quasi-experimental method was to test the effect of implementing the Edutainment method in Islamic Education learning on student learning outcomes at SMP Muhammadiyah 04 Medan which was carried out before the test and after the test was given. The experimental design carried out by the researchers was to use a two-group pre-testpost-test design.

A. Data Analysis
1. Pre-test Normality Test The data normality test is used to determine whether the data is normally distributed or not. If the data is normally distributed, it will be bell-shaped. The normality test can be seen by statistical analysis with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test provided that if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov significant value on the variable is smaller than the significance value (a = 0.05) that has been determined then the data is normally distributed. Conversely, if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov significance value on the variable is greater than the predetermined significance value (a = 0.05), then the data is not normally distributed.

The t-test table shows the effect of the edutainment method on student learning outcomes with a t-value of 3.879. The basis for making a decision to test the hypothesis in this study is t count > t table, so Ho is rejected and ha is accepted. To find out the value level of the t-table, then use the provisions of df (degree of freedom) is calculated by the number of samples (N) minus the number of variables (NR) then df = 33-2 = 31. Therefore the df used is df = 31 n Table 5

The table above shows that the pretest t-value is 0.230 while the posttest is 3.879. This means that the pretest value is lower than the posttest value. In this case the value of t-count pretest < t table, which is 0.230 < 2.04 on the pretest paper has increased by 3.879 so there is an increase in student learning outcomes of class VIII Islamic education students at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan.
Discussion
This research was carried out at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan in 2022 involving two class groups that provided different treatments. Class VIII-A is an experimental class using the edutainment method. While class VIII-B is a conventional class. This study used a quasi-experimental method with a total of 2 variables. The x variable (independent variable) is the edutainment method, while the y variable (the dependent variable) is the result of learning Islamic education in Islamic religious education. Therefore, the data presented in this study is the learning outcome data obtained before the treatment (Pretest) and the data obtained after the treatment (post-test). Before carrying out the pretest and posttest, the instruments used must first be tested for validity and reliability. The test was carried out on students who had studied Islamic education material with a total sample of 33 students of class VIII-A at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan

Based on the data obtained from this research, it is found that there is an effect of implementing the edutainment method on the learning outcomes of Islamic education lessons with a t-value of 3.879. The basis for making a decision to test the hypothesis in this study is that if the value of t count > t table then h0 is rejected and ha is accepted, which is 3.879 > 2.04, then there is an effect of implementing the edutainment method on student learning outcomes. The pretest t-count value of 0.230 while the posttest is 3.87 meaning the pretest value is lower than the posttest value so that there is an increase in the learning outcomes of PAI lessons using the edutainment method. The results of this study are in accordance with research conducted by Chemistry In Education showing that the edutainment learning model is effectively applied to students. Classes that were given the edutainment learning model treatment got good results. The data obtained by researchers on the percentage of completeness of students' cognitive learning outcomes in the experimental class of student mastery reached 29 out of 31 people. While the completeness of the control class students reached 10 out of 31 students and the average score obtained from the experimental class was 93.55% while in the control class, it was 80.18% so it can be stated that the edutainment learning model is effective and applied with very good criteria. It is aligned with the research conducted by Eriza Nur Hidayanti regarding the edutainment method at SMA Muhammadiyah Surakarta that student learning outcomes have increased with the implementation of the Humanizing the Classroom edutainment method in the form of moving classes. The percentage difference between experimental and conventional classes is 25% and the learning outcomes of the experimental class are more significant than the conventional class. From the explanation of the research above, it can be concluded that the edutainment learning model has a great influence on student learning outcomes where students are able to receive learning well when the edutainment method is applied so the results of the data obtained show a significant increase in learning outcomes when using the edutainment method in the class.
1. How to Implement the Edutainment Method in Islamic Education Subjects There are 3 ways in implementing the edutainment method, as follows: First, the implementation of the edutainment method at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan began with the teacher treating students by adjusting the character and conditions of each student, making learning fun for all students and the teacher only positioning students as facilitators. Secondly, the teacher used a method to enable students to be active in the learning process. The teacher also provided an interactive, interesting and fun learning atmosphere. Thirdly, the teacher changed the learning atmosphere to be lively and happy with group divisions. Then the teacher divided teaching materials according to the title that each group gets. The teacher also used the demonstration method in learning so that all students were active in class. It is also supported by the research conducted by Karimma Isya Karima regarding how to convey the material through the help of an LCD projector in the form of animation to students and then the teacher plays back the material that has been delivered to students so that students can absorb the material well. The displays in the form of interesting animations that utilize the Macromedia Flash program on the learning CDs used in the experimental class give a not boring impression. The second research by Zumzami on applying edutainment in the form of a moving class also supported the results of the research. In this study, the researcher decorated the class according to the material taught by the teacher, for example, when entering a geography class, students can enter a class that has an atmosphere "go green" to make students more interested and not feel bored when the teacher delivers teaching materials and learning outcomes increase. The following research that is aligned with the research above is research conducted by Subandi. In this study, the researcher applied the edutainment method by supported means in which the teacher used a tool in the form of an image to explain the material and embed the message in the material. Such an application demonstrates that the edutainment method tries to present an innovation in the learning process that prioritizes students' visualization power. Some of the explanations for applying the edutainment method above can be concluded that each teacher has his own way and strategy of integrating conventional methods with edutainment methods. Although it is different in the application yet the goal remains the same which is to increase student enthusiasm for learning and improve student learning outcomes. 2. The Effect of Edutainment Method on Learning Outcomes
Based on the data obtained from this study, it is known that the acquisition of pretest and posttest scores for the control class at intervals below 5 is 15 students while the experimental class is only 3 students. A score below 9 was obtained in the control class with 11 students, while the experimental class had 9 students. Scores above 9 were obtained more from the experimental class of 21 students and the control class of 7 students. Thus, it can be concluded that the experimental class value interval is greater than that of the control class. While the acquisition of posttest scores for the control class for value intervals below 5 is as many as 15 students while there is not found in the experimental class. Acquisition of scores below 9 in the control class is 11 students while the experimental class is 7 students. Scores above 9 were obtained more in the experimental class, with 26 students and 7 students in the control class. So it can be concluded that the value interval of the experimental class is greater than that of the control class. Based on the data obtained from the research, it is known that the acquisition of pretest scores for the control class at intervals of scores below 50 is 22 students while the experimental class is only 9 students. Acquisition of scores at intervals of 51-55 was more obtained in the experimental class with 10 students, and the acquisition of scores at intervals of 56-60 was more obtained in the experimental class with 14 students and 3 students in the control class. So it can be concluded that the value interval of the experimental class is greater than that of the control class. Meanwhile, the posttest scores for the control class at intervals below 50 were 23 students, while the experimental class only had 17 students. Acquisition of scores in the 51-55 interval was more common in the experimental class with 9 students, while in the control class, there were 7 students and the acquisition of 56-60 interval scores was found more in the experimental class with 7 students and 3 students in the control class. So it can be concluded that the value interval of the experimental class is greater than that of the control class. It can be concluded that the provision of the edutainment method in Islamic education lessons at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan has a great influence on student learning outcomes.

The results of this study are comparable to research conducted by Siti Maghfiroh where 45.75% of edutainment-based pie learning had a positive effect on the skills of students in Islamic education subjects. The second researcher who is comparable to the previous research is the research conducted by the Erlangga sisters. Based on the data obtained, the application of the edutainment method in the form of moving classes had a major effect on student learning outcomes increased by 65% and students became more knowledgeable about the material being taught. The next research which is comparable to the previous research is the research conducted by Herjan Haryadi entitled "Effectiveness of the edutainment learning strategy with the picture method on learning concentration". This study shows that what is taught with the edutainment teaching strategy has a high average compared to students who are in the conventional class. This shows that there is a considerable influence from edutainment learning strategies.
4. CONCLUSION
Based on the data obtained from the results of the t-test, the value of the t-count is 3.879 and the T-table is 2.04 with a significance level of 5%. If t count > t-table then h0 is rejected and Ha is accepted, with 3.879 > 2.04, meaning that there is a difference in learning outcomes between using the edutainment method and the conventional method. It can be concluded that the edutainment method influences student learning outcomes in class VIII on Islamic education learning at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan. The way to implement the edutainment method at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan is starting with the teacher changing the learning atmosphere to be lively and happy with the division of groups. Then the teacher divides teaching materials according to the title that each group gets. The teacher also uses the demonstration method in learning so that all students are active in class. Student learning outcomes before using the edutainment method with a t-count value of 0.230 while after using the edutainment method obtained a t-count value of 3.879. In this case, the calculated t-value in the pretest class is lower than the posttest value. This means that the edutainment method for class VIII Islamic education students at SMP Muhammadiyah 4 Medan before using the edutainment method was lower than after using the edutainment method.

1. INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of digital technology today impacts education philosophically and technically, which requires teachers to process, develop, and utilize digital devices in learning, one of which is learning media in the form of games [1]–[5]. Utilizing information and communication technology (ICT) through game media in Indonesian language learning is one alternative for facilitating elementary school student's understanding of Indonesian language materials, namely main ideas, effective sentences, advertising media, historical narrative texts, and other skills [6], [7]. The development and application of game media in Indonesian language learning in elementary schools are necessary for educators to respond to the times and

improve student learning outcomes [8]–[10]. The necessity for primary school teachers to develop games in learning aligns with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s teacher ICT framework, which lists the competencies required by teachers to integrate ICT into learning and teachers' professional practices [11]−[14]. According to UNESCO, the six aspects of the teacher ICT framework are understanding ICT in education, curriculum and assessment, pedagogy, ICT, organization and administration, and professional teacher learning [15]. Elementary school teachers must implement these six aspects through the development and application of game media in learning because the core of digital-based learning lies in the ability of teachers to integrate ICT into education and learning [16]–[18]. Conceptually, game media development in elementary schools is the creativity, style, and renewal carried out by teachers in the field of technology to form digital-based professional education and realize students' full potential [19]–[21]. In addition, there is also a need for innovation in learning media application games based on local wisdom, which is a new idea for developing learning media to increase learning motivation and understanding of Indonesian language material delivered by elementary school [22]–[24]. Several studies in the last decade have explored local wisdom-based learning media, such as research on myths and ecological wisdom [25], educational game with android based on Timorese local wisdom in learning mathematics [26], disaster education through indigenous disaster mitigation at elementary school in Indonesia [27], research and development of animation media with local wisdom in elementary schools in Indonesia [28], local wisdom-based Math learning media on the concept of social arithmetic [29], learning media with topeng barongan local wisdom to strengthen the Pancasila student profile of elementary school students [30], Kizzugemu visual novel game in Javanese language learning in elementary school in Magelang district [31], and research on interactive Biology modules based on Bengkulu local wisdom [32]. while current research on learning media with Microsoft PowerPoint, iSpring Free 9, and Web2Apk applications exist on android media with Microsoft Office PowerPoint, iSpring Suite 10, and Website 2 Apk builder in learning organic chemistry [33], android-based learning media with PowerPoint, iSpring Free 9, and Web2Apk applications on English news text material at the high school level [34], furthermore, research and development of learning media with iSpring Suite 9 in the automation of governance and infrastructure in higher education [35]. From those researches, a few still examine media games based on the local wisdom of Magelang Regency, Central Java, which utilize Microsoft PowerPoint, iSpring Free 9, and Web2Apk. The theme of Magelang local wisdom in learning game media is in line with the national education goals [36], [37], as stated in Law Number 20 of 2003 on the National Education System [38], and Regulation of the Minister of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 of 2022 [39]. The regulation mandates that the education system in Indonesia not only aims to educate the nation's children but also to shape the nation's children into cultured Indonesians [40], [41]. However, currently, not many educators can develop learning media by inserting cultural values in it based on the teacher ICT framework, according to UNESCO [13], Ibda et al. [42], and Bardule [43], even though education has a role in inheriting and maintaining and maintaining culture integrated into educational ICT [44]–[46]. The education process is relevant, and the preparation of the nation's generation [47]. Thus, the main provision for students to live social life can be obtained from the education process at school. Based on this, it encourages teachers to make innovations in developing game media based on Magelang local wisdom in Indonesian language learning in elementary schools called benkangen game. In this research, benkangen game is an innovative form of game application development with Microsoft PowerPoint assisted by iSpring Free application and Apk 2 Web Builder. There are several learning game media developed using Microsoft PowerPoint assisted by iSpring Free application, and Apk 2 Web Builder, such as interactive quizzes for science subjects, Pirate Tales, Knight Adventure, Spin Game, and many more, and have a positive impact on elementary school students because they build an interactive, communicative atmosphere and a constructive environment [48]. However, in reality, few still develop in Indonesian language learning with the theme of Magelang local wisdom. Hence, this benkangen game is a novel development that inserts the theme of local wisdom in learning. The fun game atmosphere and student-centred learning climate presented by benkangen game are expected to answer the needs of ICT advancement and improve students' understanding of the learning material. The needs analysis was conducted through questionnaires to teachers and students of grade 5 elementary schools and madrasah ibtidaiyah (Islamic elementary school) in Magelang district and Magelang city. The number of teachers who were given a questionnaire was 25, and 66 students in 10 schools. The needs analysis questionnaire for students contains the need for easy Indonesian language learning, the need for Indonesian language learning media other than textbooks and modules, the need for the use of digital-based media (games), the need for Indonesian language material packaged into digital games, and the need for digitalbased educational media learning (games) that attract students. In comparison, the needs analysis questionnaire for teachers contains the need for student activeness and enthusiasm in learning Indonesian, the need for good learning outcomes in learning Indonesian, the need for solutions to low enthusiasm in learning Indonesian, the need for the use of digital-based media in learning Indonesian, the need for types of media that make learning

Indonesian easy, the need for interactive game-based educational media with the theme of local wisdom in learning Indonesian, the need for local wisdom material in digital-based game media, the need for game-based Indonesian learning media with local wisdom in grade 5 elementary school, suggestions and comments for the game to be developed. The development of benkangen game media is motivated by the analysis of media needs from students and teachers, the lack of learning media development, especially in Indonesian language subjects, the lack of innovation by teachers in developing learning media, passive students and less enthusiastic about the learning process carried out so that it is difficult to understand the material presented. There are no gamebased Indonesian language learning media with the theme of Magelang local wisdom. The novelty in this research is benkangen game media with Magelang local wisdom in Microsoft PowerPoint, iSpring Free 9, and Web2Apk applications. Therefore, the researcher asked four research questions: − How is the development of the benkangen game based on Magelang local wisdom using PowerPoint software assisted by iSpring free application and web app 2 builders? − How are the features of benkangen game media based on Magelang local wisdom? − How is the feasibility of the benkangen game according to media and material experts − How is the implementation and impact of the benkangen game based on Magelang local wisdom in elementary schools?
2. METHOD

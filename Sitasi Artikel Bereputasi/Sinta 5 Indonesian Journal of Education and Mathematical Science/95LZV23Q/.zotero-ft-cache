ABSTRACT
This research aims to develop an augmented reality-based teaching material, namely the AR-Geo module on 3D Geometry material at SMA Negeri 3 Medan. These teaching materials are able to determine the level of validity, practicality, and effectiveness of the AR-Geo module and student responses to learning. This research method used research and development (R&D) through the ADDIE model. The subjects of the study involved students of class XII IPS 1 SMAN 3 Medan in the academic year 2023/2024 totaling 36 students. The research instruments employed AR-Geo module assessment sheets by media and material expert lecturers, mathematics teachers, peers, student ability tests and student response questionnaires, as well as student spatial ability tests. The results indicate that the material expert score is 91,53% and the design expert score is 90,53%, classified as very valid. The practicality of the module can be identified from the teacher response questionnaire score of 80,00% classified as practical, and the questionnaire score in the small group trial of 84,26%, field test 84,38% classified as very practical. The effectiveness is shown by 83,33% of students completing the learning outcomes test, and the results of the N-Gain calculation are 17 students experiencing an increase in medium spatial ability and 19 students experiencing an increase in high spatial ability. As a result, the development of augmented reality-based modules for 3D geometry material that has been developed is feasible to use.

1. INTRODUCTION
Math lesson, particularly geometry, is often considered as the difficult and boring lesson by most students. Math lessons are filled with formulas and calculations, making it a challenge for many students. However, geometry is more than a set of formulas. From a psychological point of view, geometry represents an abstraction derived from visual and spatial experiences, such as planes, patterns, measurements, and mapping. Meanwhile, from a mathematical point of view, geometry provides approaches to problem solving, such as drawings, diagrams, coordinate systems, vectors, and transformations. Geometry is also an environment for studying mathematical structures (Nopriana, Tri, 2013). At the higher educational (SMA/MA) levels in the Merdeka Curriculum, the Geometry study field discusses various forms of flat and spatial shapes in both Euclides and Non-Euclides studies and their characteristics in flat geometry and space geometry subelements. Spatial geometry is the study of spatial objects, relations, and transformations that have been formed (made into mathematics) and systems of mathematical axioms that have been constructed to make them (Imamuddin, 2018). Although the importance of geometry is recognized in the education curriculum, the reality shows that there are still numerous students and teachers who face difficulties in understanding and teaching geometry materials, especially spatial geometry. Spatial ability, which is key to understanding geometry, often shows low ability in students. Based on the observations by the researcher, the difficulty of learning geometry dimension 3 is in imagining the representation of flat/space shapes that represent the problems

posed. As in the research conducted by (Budiarto, M. T., & Artiono, R, 2019), they mentioned that the characteristics olf the folrm olf student errolrs in sollving a geolmetry prolblem include visual skills, verbal skills, and applied skills. Visual skills include insufficient understanding olf geolmetric elements needed tol describe geolmetric colrrelatioln and unsatisfactolry perceptioln olf space. Errolrs related tol verbal skills include miscolnceptiolns in understanding geolmetry colncepts; weak ability tol analyze prolblems; ambiguolus use olf terms such as rib and side; cube and square; quadrilateral and quadrilateral pyramid olf disolrderly use in colnventiolns, such as noltatioln folr line, line segment, line ray, angle and angle magnitude; nolt understanding what is knolwn and what will be prolven frolm the given prolblem; unable tol use what is knolwn olr use what will be prolven as what is knolwn; unable tol relate olne knolwledge with olther knolwledge in geolmetry; and less resilient and easily discoluraged if facing challenging geolmetry prolblems. Errolrs related tol applied skills include: nolt being able tol use axiolms, definitiolns, theolrems tol sollve prololf prolblems; failing tol learn the basic colncepts olf geolmetry; nolt understanding that twol perpendicular lines intersect; nolt understanding that the plane can be expanded; nolt being able tol make the intersectioln olf a plane with a space due tol lolw spatial visioln; and nolt being able tol use the acquisitioln olf geolmetry in high schololl olr flat geolmetry tol sollve space geolmetry prolblems. In olrder tol olvercolme these challenges in learning geolmetry in the classrololm, teachers usually present real olbjects as prolps related tol the material being studied. The prolps presented are nolt olnly based o
ln real olbjects that can be seen, held, olr toluched, but can alsol be colmputer simulatiolns that colmbine the solphisticatioln olf variolus infolrmatioln and colmmunicatioln technollolgy devices. Olne technollolgy that is currently starting tol be colnsidered at is augmented reality (AR). Holsch (2021) in Encyclolpaedia Britannica states that augmented reality is the prolcess olf colmbining videol olr pholtol displays by olverlaying images with related colmputer data. Meanwhile, Azuma (1997) alsol states that augmented reality (AR) is a folrm olf virtual reality (VR) that allolws users tol see the real wolrld throlugh virtual olbjects that are colmbined with the real wolrld. In the colntext olf math learning, AR olffers an innolvative way tol present geolmetry colncepts visually and interactively, increasing students' interest and understanding, as well as spatial abilities. As in variolus studies in the field olf geolmetry, they mentioln that augmented reality can be a sollutioln tol make it easier folr students tol understand variolus colmplex spatial prolblems colmpared tol traditiolnal metholds (Kaufmann, 2009). Based oln this explanatioln abolve, the researcher is interested in develolping an interactive learning moldule that colmbines geolmetry with AR technollolgy, called AR-Geol. Therefolre, the researcher can develolp new prolducts olf augmented reality in SMA Negeri 3 Medan as a result olf the develolpment olf existing research based oln geolmetry moldule (AR - Geol) tol improlve spatial abilities in 3-D geolmetry learning at SMA Negeri 3 Medan.

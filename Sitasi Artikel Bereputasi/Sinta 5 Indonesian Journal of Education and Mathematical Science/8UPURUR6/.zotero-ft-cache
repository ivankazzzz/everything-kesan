1. INTRODUCTION
Technological developments change the teacher's task from a teacher in charge of delivering subject matter to a facilitator who provides convenience in learning. The rapid development of technology raises questions about the teacher's task as a teacher whether it is still necessary for teachers to teach in front of the class alone, write material on the blackboard, and then assign students to copy it, and so on. For this reason, teachers must always develop their potential professionally in accordance with current technological developments therefore the teacher's task as a teacher is still needed.
According to Barnawi (2012), the use of technology in schools is something that must be done by teachers. Teachers can use technology as a medium of learning. This technology can make it easier for teachers to describe or illustrate the material being studied. This will clarify things between theory and practice so that students are able to see the real thing. In addition, teachers can also use learning media related to technology to expand and deepen knowledge for themselves and their students. The Regulation of the Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 81A of 2013 states that the principle of developing a learning implementation plan in the 2013 Curriculum must apply technology, information, and communication in the learning process. For this reason, teachers are required to be able to use technology well.
The rapid development of technology is currently based on the development of mathematics in various fields. Mathematics is one of the fields of study that supports the development of science and technology (Sundayana, 2013). Mathematics needs to be given to all students starting from elementary school to equip students with logical and critical thinking skills. As an educator, the teacher must be able to improve the ability to master the technology so that they are able to provide mathematics lessons that are in accordance with current needs.
2. METODHOLOGY
The method of this research was Research and Development (R & D) according to Borg and Gall. The research subjects involved were one media expert, one material expert, a mathematics study teacher, and seventh-grade students at MTs Al-Washliyah Tebing Tinggi. The experts gave an assessment of the feasibility of the product developed by the researcher, while the students and teachers responded about the attractiveness of the product developed.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Based on observations made in class VIII of MTs Al Washliyah Tebing Tinggi, students' ability to understand mathematics is still low. The lack of use of learning media can be one of the factors for the low student understanding of mathematics. In addition, there are still many students who look less enthusiastic and are busy talking with their friends. They do not pay attention to the teacher when explaining the material being studied. This can have an impact on the low ability of students to understand concepts related to mathematics, even though mathematics lessons are very useful to be applied in everyday life where we will certainly do money transactions, count time, add up goods, and so on.
The next problem that the researchers found in the observations in class VIII of MTs Al Washliyah Tebing Tinggi was the use of power points by teachers who were not attracted to students. The learning carried out was less meaningful for students and tended to be teacher-centered. Teachers must be able to create effective and efficient mathematics learning by instilling concepts in students, therefore, students are able to understand and remember the material in the long term which it can make learning outcomes increase and there are no misconceptions about the material being studied.
According to Mulyasa (2016), learning should be involving as many students as possible so that they are able to explore form competencies by exploring various potentials. For this reason, teacher creativity is needed so that they are able to become facilitators and learning partners for students. Teacher creativity can be done by creating and developing learning media and other teaching aids that are useful for improving the quality of learning.
Learning media needs to be developed by utilizing technology that is supported by the availability of existing facilities in schools. Learning media in the form of video is one of the appropriate alternatives to be used in class VIII of MTs Al Washliyah Tebing Tinggi. There are facilities that support the use of video.

According to Munir (2015), one of the advantages of video is that it can enrich presentations or explanations effectively and efficiently. Teachers can use several applications that can be presented in the form of videos, including video scribe, PowToon, Animaker, and so on. Villar stated that PowToon is a web-based application provided for users to create animated videos by manipulating objects, importing images, and providing music and users can add sounds (Andrianti, 2016).
The use of PowToon animation learning media is based on previous research conducted by Asyifa (2018) which states that learning videos made with PowToon are feasible to use and can improve students' understanding of mathematical concepts. The differences between this study and previous studies are 1) the video duration is longer, which is approximately 13 minutes; 2) various animations are used to serve as illustrations related to everyday life, and 3) using sound recordings as support to clarify the material presented.
Based on these problems, the researchers conducted a study entitled "Development of Animation VideoBased Learning Media on the Polyhedron Material Assisted by Powtoon Software". The problem formulated based on the background above is “How is the process of developing PowToon animation learning media in the mathematics subject of polyhedron in class VIII?”

Discussion
The media chosen in this development is PowToon animation learning media because PowToon provides more animation than other applications. The animation can also be arranged easily according to the user's wishes so that it is easy to use and provides an illustration related to the material to be presented. PowToon Animation is an application that has powerful features on one screen, which can create various animations as needed. In the study, it was also stated that animation has many advantages, such as being able to eliminate boredom in learning, arouse enthusiasm for learning, and of course, animation can attract students' attention to stay focused on the learning process (Hasbulah, 2018).
The development of PowToon animation learning media is packed with content that contains an illustration related to the material around rectangles, and triangles. The content is adjusted to the learning objectives to be achieved from the learning process by using this animated media in the form of video. Learning using video media is done so that the delivery of material can be more interesting and clear (Latif, 2013).
The success of developing PowToon animation learning media in mathematics in grade IV is proven through media validation by media experts and material experts, teacher and student responses, and students' understanding after using this learning media. The validation test that has been carried out by the first media expert in terms of appearance obtained a percentage of 90.77%, in terms of presentation it obtained a percentage of 80%, and in terms of effects obtained a percentage of 80%. The feasibility test by the first media expert obtained a percentage of 87% with a very feasible category.
The validation test that has been carried out by the second media expert in terms of appearance obtained a percentage of 100%, in terms of presentation it obtained a percentage of 93.33%, and in terms of effects, it obtained a percentage of 85%. The feasibility test by the second media expert obtained a percentage of 96% with a very feasible category.
In addition, the validation test that was carried out by the first material expert in terms of content obtained a percentage of 88.33%, and in terms of the presentation obtained a percentage of 87.5%. The feasibility test by the first material expert obtained a percentage of 88% in the very feasible category. Meanwhile, the validation test that has been carried out by the second material expert in terms of content obtained a percentage of 80% and in terms of presentation, it obtained a percentage of 87.5%.

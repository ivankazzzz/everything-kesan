1. INTRODUCTION
Education is a crucial aspect in the development of individuals and society. In the increasingly developing digital era, education must also adapt to rapid technological changes. Informatics Engineering subjects are an important part of the educational curriculum which equips students with knowledge and skills in information technology. However, in facing these challenges, there is a need to introduce learning methods that are more innovative and relevant to an increasingly connected world. One potential learning method is the development of interactive multimedia based on Android. The Android platform has dominated the mobile device market with the number of users continuing to increase. Therefore, Using Android as a basis for developing interactive multimedia in the classroom can be an effective approach to improving the quality of learning. This technology allows students to learn in a more interesting and engaged way, which in turn can improve their understanding of Informatics Engineering concepts.
However, despite its great potential, there has not been much in-depth research regarding the use of Android-based interactive multimedia in the context of learning Information Engineering at the high school (SMA) level, especially in class X. Therefore, this article aims to describe the development and application of multimedia Android-based interactive on Engineering subjects. Informatics at high school level. It is hoped that this research will provide a clearer view of the potential and benefits of this learning approach and provide a basis for further development in this field. With this innovation, it is hoped that learning about Informatics Engineering in high school can become more interesting, interactive and effective in preparing the younger generation to face the demands of the ever-growing digital world.

2. RESEARCH METHOD
The Research and Development (R&D) model is an approach used to develop or enhance products, processes, or technologies. Sugiyono (2011:297) writes that research and development methods are research methods used to produce a product and test the effectiveness of the product. The development model used is the model according to Thiagarajan, namely the 4D model which consists of 4 stages, namely definition, design, development and dissemination. The validity test of Android-based interactive multimedia products was tested on media experts and material experts. Meanwhile, the practicality test of Android-based interactive multimedia products was tested on 33 students of X.E4 SMA N 1 Suliki District. In this research, the researcher chose the subject of Informatics Engineering with material on Computer Networks and the Internet. The material discusses computer networks, types of computer networks, internet networks, and internet connections.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Research Results
In this research, a multimedia interactive Android-based application has been successfully developed for the subject of Computer Engineering in grade X of high school, which can enhance students' understanding. The presentation of research results follows the steps in developing research using the 4D model, namely the definition, design, development and dissemination stages. In this research, the focus is on the development stage because the main goal is to create interactive multimedia products for Informatics Engineering subjects, computer network and internet material. 1) Definition Stage (Define) The definition stage in this research includes several important steps. First, through curriculum analysis, researchers found that SMA N 1 Suliki District uses an independent curriculum which encourages students to be more active in learning. Furthermore, student analysis revealed that many students did not pay attention when the teacher explained the material due to the lack of variety in the use of learning media. In addition, concept analysis highlights the complexity of Informatics Engineering material, especially in the topic of Computer Networks and the Internet, which involves a number of important concepts. Finally, in formulating learning objectives, the main goal is for students to be able to explain the basic concepts of computer networks, including types of networks, topology, and the main components used in forming networks. 2) Design Stage (Design) Creating an initial interactive multimedia design that refers to the concept that has been created. The media was created using iSpring Suite 11 Software. The display presented in the interactive multimedia consists of: (1) opening intro scene,(2) main menu scene, (3) media developer profile scene, (4) learning objectives scene, (5) ). guide scene, (6) material content scene, (7) quiz scene. In the finishing stage, the media format was changed to Android. The Android-based interactive multimedia design can be seen in the following image:

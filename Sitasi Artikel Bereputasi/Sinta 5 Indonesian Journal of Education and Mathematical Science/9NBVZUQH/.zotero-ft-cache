1. INTRODUCTION
The digital era is a time when community activities and information are disseminated more quickly and easily using digital technology. Digital technology is technology that uses a computer system connected to the Internet. In this case, the Internet plays an important role in the digital age. Internet connectivity is also increasingly advanced to support community productivity in the digital age. The ease of Internet connectivity makes it easier for people to disseminate information through their devices. One of the most widely used means of disseminating information is social media. Social media is very important in disseminating information to the wider community. Since its inception, social media has been designed as a platform for its users to easily participate, share and exchange information/ideas in a community or virtual network. The development of social media currently makes it easy for people to view and find information online (D. N. Sari & Basit, 2020). Social media users can play an active role in choosing and using these media (Harbert Blummer and Elhu Katz, 1974). In today's digital age, it is easy for many people to find information, knowledge and sources that are easily accessible. Social media also makes it easier for us to interact with many people without worrying about distance and time. It is easier for us to be creative and spread information faster and at a much more affordable cost. Not only that, social media is also widely used as a means of earning income, da'wah institutions, facilitating the learning process, distributing information and news, as well as a place to express our hobbies and ideals. Some examples of social media in today's digital age are Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter and blogs/websites. Social media can be used according to our needs and the benefits we get from it. Along with the numerous benefits of social media, there are also negative effects if we do not use them carefully.
2. METHODOLOGY
The method used in this research was descriptive qualitative. Descriptive qualitative is a research that describes or depicts the object of research based on the facts that appear or as they are. This research describes the various types of social media used in the digital age and the benefits of using social media in the digital era. The data collection technique in this research was library research or literature study. Literature study is to record all issues in research, unite existing research and new research, analyse research from various sources/references discussed, provide ideas from existing research results and generate new thoughts (M. Sari & Asmendri, 2018). The literature review uses various references (articles, scientific journals, books, dissertations, theses, internet) that are relevant to the discussion of the use of social media in the digital era.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
A. Types of Social Media in the Digital Age
Social media is a media that allows users to represent themselves in interacting, building cooperation, sharing and communication with other users in forming virtual social relationships (Nasrullah, 2015). Some social media platforms that are widely used in the digital era are as follows: 1. Instagram Instagram is a social media platform that is popular and favoured by the public and can be accessed through devices or laptops. Instagram was founded by one of the best known companies, Burbn, Inc with founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. Instagram is designed to share information through a post in the form of a photo or video. According to Napoleon Cat, Instagram users in October 2021 totalled 91.01 million users, a number that is reported to have decreased compared to August 2021, which totalled 98.06 million users (Annur, 2021). The majority of Instagram users are aged 18-24 years old. This is the age of students, especially university students (Keifer & Effenberger, 1967) (Ambarsari, 2020). The role of Instagram in the digital age is as a place to share photos and videos that we have, both privately and together. Many people use Instagram as a place to express their hobbies in the form of photos and videos, such as a video of someone playing a musical instrument and exercising. Instagram is also widely used by artists as a forum to become a brand ambassador or endorsee by posting on Instagram feeds or Instastories related to the goods or products they wish to endorse, providing product details both written and verbal, the benefits and uses. 2. Youtube YouTube is one of the platforms created by 3 paypal employees, in February 2005, and is widely used in this era of digitalization. The YouTube channel is widely used as a place to share hobbies, preach, vlogs, blogs, and other content that is interesting, cool, funny, sad, horror, and other content that can attract viewers to visit our YouTube channel. YouTube is widely used as a place to share hobbies, preach, vlog and so on. In addition, many YouTube users use the platform to listen to music, watch short films, trailers, news and so on. In general, YouTube users visit the application not only for entertainment, but also for academic and information purposes. The largest number of YouTube users is between the ages of 18 to 29 years. The Central Bureau of Statistics suggests the results that this age include teenagers to college students. In this case, YouTube also plays a very important role in the age of digitalisation.

WhatsApp is one of the free applications for Android and iOS platform users that offers a very simple and safe messaging and calling service to use whenever and wherever we are. This application was founded by Jan Koum and Brian Acton. In this digital era, WhatsApp is often used to communicate with the wider community, as a learning media and as an online trading media. WhatsApp is used for commercial purposes by offering products through contacts saved in WhatsApp, by sending and offering products through broadcast messages, or by sending them to groups that we have joined. However, the majority of people use WhatsApp to communicate virtually, both through chat and through live and video calls. As a learning medium, WhatsApp is used in online learning. WhatsApp allows students to share material or knowledge using status or WhatsApp Story. In addition, students can share photos, videos or website links through status. Students can have virtual discussions using video calls to discuss learning. B. The Benefits of Social Media in the Digital Age
In the current digital age, social media provides many benefits for different sectors. The benefits of social media that we most frequently find are in the areas of education and economy. Here are the benefits of social media in the digital age in the fields of education and economy. 1. Education Sector The use of social media in education is currently widespread. Based on the recent research conducted by We Are Social and Hootsuite, it was revealed that Indonesians have a large number of social media users, reaching 130 million active users using various social media such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and others. Furthermore, We Are Social's report in January 2018 also revealed that Indonesia's total population reached 256.4 million occupations, with internet user penetration reaching 132.7 users. With the high number of social media users in Indonesia, it is not difficult to use social media as a learning medium. Through social media, a variety of knowledge can be accessed by students, making them more active in exploring and innovating to enhance their creativity. The ease of accessing information digitally makes them more independent as they do not have to wait for the teacher to explain in class. Social media can also be used as a platform to develop language skills. These language skills start from reading, understanding and selecting different information to develop their writing skills through captions, which can be narratives, poems or other writings and works that are then shared through the features available on social media (Achmad Ridwan, 2021). This is one of the advantages of social media, which is the wide range of interaction activities and information sharing (Selwyn, 2009). In order to use social media as a learning medium, there are several aspects that need to be considered. There are five aspects that need to be considered when using the media, which are (a) student characteristics, (b) learning objectives, (c) the nature of the teaching materials, (d) the acquisition of the media, and (e) the nature of the use of the media. In addition to the advantages for students, social media also has an impact on teachers. Teachers in the digital age are teachers who are able to integrate technology into their learning. One of the requirements for a professional teacher in the digital era is a teacher who, in addition to the pedagogical, personal, social and professional competencies mentioned above, also has insight, interest, concern, sensitivity, affection, as well as the ability and skill to use it. The use of digital technology is very important for the following reasons: a) The quality of education in Indonesia falls far behind other countries. This gap is due to the low quality of teachers, and the reasons include the low quality of teachers in terms of insight, interest, concern, sensitivity, preference, and ability and skill in using technology. b) Relevant functions of digital technology to be integrated in learning Sudarno Sudirdjo and Eveline Siregar (2004:9-12) found that there are eight functions of learning technology, including digital technology, which are (1) to provide knowledge of learning objectives, (2) to motivate students, (3) to present information, (4) to stimulate discussion, (5) to guide student activities, (6) to conduct exercises and tests, (7) to reinforce learning, and (8) to provide simulation experiences. c) Digital technology is a revolutionary process that needs to be embraced. The concept of learning in a digital society emphasises moving, motivating, bridging, facilitating, so that students are moved to carry out various activities in order to obtain the knowledge they want. This is then reinforced, enriched or corrected by the teacher. Teachers must teach to keep up with the times by integrating technology into learning. Therefore, learning media can be utilised by teachers as learning media to improve learning effectiveness. Some of these benefits are: a) As a means of communication Social media facilitates communication between students, teachers, and families. When students find it difficult to learn in class, social media helps students to communicate further so that learning can be absorbed better. b) Supporting online learning activities Learning media can be used to support online learning to make it more effective and not monotonous. c) Enhancing creativity Social media can be used to improve skills and means of self-expression. Learning using social media can also be used as a way to increase and spur student creativity. d) Means of supporting research

Social media can be used as research material, and tools in research for example, the use of online form applications and the use of data available online, etc. In addition, another benefit is that students can also join various researchers as followers according to the research topic. e) Means of globalisation Through social media, interaction between students and various people in the world is possible. Students can get to know people from different cultures from other countries such as language, tradition, lifestyle etc. In addition, it also allows students to get course opportunities from various schools across the country, some even for free because it is done online. 2. Economy Sector The utilisation of social media in the digital era also extends to the economic field or known as the digital economy. Digital economy is an economic activity that utilizes the help of the internet and artificial intelligence (AI). The existence of a digital economy can facilitate economic activities in general, especially in the business world. Social media has provided special features for businesses. Here are some of the benefits of social media for business: a) Increase sales b) Find potential customers quickly c) Give feedback faster and easier d) Attract consumers e) Increase website visitors f) Branding g) Share information faster h) Promote at an affordable cost
4. CONCLUSION
In the digital age, community activities and information are disseminated more quickly and easily through digital technology. When it comes to disseminating information to the wider community, social media is crucial. Social media also makes it easy for us to interact with many people without worrying about distance and time. Some social media platforms that are widely used in the digital age are Instagram, Youtube, Whatshapp, Facebook, Twitter and Tiktok. There are many benefits from the use of social media in today's digital age, both in education, business, social and other areas. The use of social media can be used as a source of knowledge, a source of entertainment and a source of the latest information. Based on the results of the research and the results of the discussion described in the previous chapter, the following suggestions can be made: 1. Information on social media is sometimes a hoax. Therefore, people need to filter this information wisely. 2. For further research, if you want to conduct research that is relevant to this research, it is hoped that you can get results that were not found in this study in order to get different results regarding the use of social media in the digital age.
